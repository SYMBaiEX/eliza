This guide will walk through updates as they relate to plugins (hint: everything is a plugin).\\n\\n{/* truncate */}\\n\\n## What\'s New\\n\\nThe codebase is more compact in order to be easier to work with. V2 also features a formal API specification for better definition and compatibility. When it comes to plugins, here\'s what\'s new:\\n\\n- **No central repo needed**: Host your plugin in your own GitHub repo\\n- **One-line integration**: Add plugins to your `package.json` and `agent.json`.\\n- **Open registry**: Submit a PR to get listed on the [Plugin Registry](https://elizaos.github.io/registry).\\n- **Dynamic loading**: Load plugins from external repositories\\n\\nMany of these improvements were already being adopted in V1 toward the end of its lifecycle in order to create a natural evolution path for developers already familiar with the platform.\\n\\n## \ud83e\udde9 How to Add a Plugin in V2\\n\\nThe ElizaOS V2 ecosystem already includes plugins for:\\n\\n- Blockchain integration (Solana, Ethereum)\\n- Social media (Twitter, Discord, Telegram)\\n- Data processing (PDF, Image, Video)\\n- External APIs (Browser, Web Search)\\n- Local LLM deployment (Llama)\\n\\n> See the plugin showcase here: https://eliza.how/packages\\n\\n![](/img/montage-plugins.jpg)\\n\\nHere are steps on how to add your plugin:\\n\\n### 1. Package.json Integration\\n\\n```bash\\n# Install plugin directly from GitHub\\nnpm install @elizaos/plugin-example@github:your-org/plugin-example\\n\\n# Or update package.json manually\\n\\"dependencies\\": {\\n  \\"@elizaos/plugin-example\\": \\"github:your-org/plugin-example\\"\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### 2. Agent Configuration\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \\"name\\": \\"MyAgent\\",\\n  \\"plugins\\": [\\"@elizaos/plugin-example\\"]\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThe plugin will be automatically loaded when your agent starts.\\n\\n## \ud83d\udee0 Plugin Architecture\\n\\nElizaOS V2 uses a unified plugin architecture where everything is a plugin:\\n\\n```typescript\\ntype Plugin = {\\n  name: string;\\n  description: string;\\n  clients?: Client[];\\n  adapters?: Adapter[];\\n  actions?: Action[];\\n  services?: Service[];\\n  providers?: Provider[];\\n  evaluators?: Evaluator[];\\n};\\n```\\n\\nThis means you can extend virtually any aspect of your agent\'s functionality:\\n- Platform connections (Discord, Twitter, Telegram)\\n- Storage options (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis)\\n- Action capabilities (what your agent can do)\\n- Service providers (background processes and specialized capabilities)\\n- Evaluation components (how your agent makes decisions)\\n\\n## \ud83d\udcc2 Creating Your Own Plugin\\n\\nThe minimal structure for a V2 plugin repository:\\n\\n```\\nplugin-example/\\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 assets/\\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 logo.png       # 400x400 branding\\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 banner.png     # 1280x640 banner\\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 screenshots/   # Usage examples\\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 src/\\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 index.ts       # Plugin entry point\\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 ...

Host your plugin on GitHub\\n2. Add branding, docs, and working examples\\n3. Submit a [PR to the registry](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry)\\n\\nSince the plugin lives in your repo you can start using it right away. The registry mainly helps with discovery, just know the review process typically takes up to a week so be prepared for that.\\n\\n### More Links\\n\\n- [elizaos-plugins.github.io/registry](https://elizaos-plugins.github.io/registry)\\n- [Packages explorer](packages)\\n- [Plugin Guide](https://eliza.how/docs/plugins)"},{"id":"/scaling-daos","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/scaling-daos","editUrl":"https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/tree/v2-develop/docs/blog/scaling-daos.mdx","source":"@site/blog/scaling-daos.mdx","title":"Scaling DAOs with AI Agents","description":"Everyone talks about decentralization, AI agents, and coordination games.

One of the biggest challenges facing players is locating critical information like who does what or updates scattered when it\'s across Discord channels, GitHub repositories, forums, threads, etc. No human, regardless of how dedicated, can keep track of everything.\\n\\n![XKCD comic about information scattering](/blog/xkcd1810.png)\\nhttps://xkcd.com/1810/\\n\\nEven when information is theoretically \\"public,\\" people are generally too lazy to fetch it. That and stakeholders may prefer different information formats:\\n\\n- Developers dig into GitHub\\n- Community vibes on Discord\\n- Casual followers scroll Twitter\\n- Visual learners watch videos\\n\\nInstead of forcing everyone onto one highway early on, a better strategy would be to build bridges between lanes to allow information to flow more freely. AI agents are the vehicles for that information, they carry the ability to meet people where they are to deliver important insights while preserving context.\\n\\n### Goals\\n\\n- Reduce overhead on managing comms / community questions\\n- Keep people informed across different platforms\\n- Accelerate onboarding for new contributors\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Case Study: AI News System\\n\\nThis [discord summarizer](https://github.com/elizaOS/discord-summarizer) was the first prototype. For ElizaOS we\'re now using [this AI News tool](https://github.com/bozp-pzob/ai-news) to aggregate sources from across the ecosystem. The system works in four key stages:\\n\\n1. **Collection**: APIs pull data from multiple sources including Twitter, Discord, GitHub, and market data platforms.\\n2. **Wrangling**: LLMs normalize, summarize, and tag topics to create a unified knowledge base from disparate sources.\\n3. **Distribution**: The system produces standardized outputs in multiple formats (JSON, Markdown, RSS) to suit different consumption needs.\\n4. **Consumption**: Users can access tailored products like dashboards, newsletters, or even 3D news shows.\\n\\n```mermaid\\nflowchart TD\\n    subgraph \\"Data Collection\\"\\n        A1[Twitter API] --\x3e B[Data Collector]\\n        A2[Discord Bot] --\x3e B\\n        A3[GitHub API] --\x3e B\\n        A4[Market Data APIs] --\x3e B\\n    end\\n    style A1 fill:#6CB9E5,color:#333\\n    style A2 fill:#7289DA,color:#FFF\\n    style A3 fill:#333333,color:#FFF\\n    style A4 fill:#85bb65,color:#FFF\\n    style B fill:#9F8AF9,color:#FFF\\n\\n    subgraph \\"Data Wrangling & Enrichment\\"\\n        B --\x3e C[Content Normalization]\\n        C --\x3e D[Topic Extraction/LLM]\\n        D --\x3e E[Summarization/LLM]\\n        E --\x3e F[Storage/SQLite]\\n    end\\n    style C fill:#FFA500,color:#333\\n    style D fill:#FF7F50,color:#333\\n    style E fill:#CD5C5C,color:#FFF\\n    style F fill:#4682B4,color:#FFF\\n\\n    subgraph \\"Distribution\\"\\n        F --\x3e G1[JSON API Endpoints]\\n        F --\x3e G2[Markdown Files]\\n        F --\x3e G3[RSS Feeds]\\n    end\\n    style G1 fill:#7EB77F,color:#333\\n    style G2 fill:#86C67C,color:#333\\n    style G3 fill:#98FB98,color:#333\\n\\n    subgraph \\"Consumption\\"\\n        G1 --\x3e H1[DAO Dashboards]\\n        G1 --\x3e H2[AI Agent Knowledge Base]\\n        G2 --\x3e H3[Newsletter/Blog]\\n        G3 --\x3e H4[3D News Show]\\n    end\\n    style H1 fill:#DDA0DD,color:#333\\n    style H2 fill:#DA70D6,color:#333\\n    style H3 fill:#BA55D3,color:#FFF\\n    style H4 fill:#9370DB,color:#FFF\\n```\\n\\nYou can see the results from this tool here, which updates daily via GitHub actions:\\n\\n- https://m3-org.github.io/ai-news/\\n- https://eliza.how/news\\n\\n<div className=\\"responsive-iframe\\">\\n  <iframe\\n    src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/fIGoyaEd0Hw\\"\\n    title=\\"YouTube video player\\"\\n    allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\\"\\n    allowFullScreen\\n  />\\n</div>\\nHere\'s an example news clip: https://x.com/elizaOS/status/1880280863210106975\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Case Study: AI Assistants\\n\\nIdk about you, but I hate seeing questions left hanging in tech support channels, especially when the answer can easily be found in the docs. It\'s a perfect opportunity to [eat our own dogfood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food), experience and fix pain points firsthand, and showcase a powerful use case of AI agents to other devs.\\n\\n[![jintern2](/blog/jintern.jpg)](/blog/jintern.jpg)\\n\\nWhile we\'re analyzing tech support channels, we can identify gaps in docs based on common community questions which can then be addressed systematically. This may involve checking if any github issues or pull requests already address a question, and if not, then to help create an issue for it. Herein lies a powerful feedback loop:\\n\\n- Aggregate & Analyze: Extract questions and answers, who is helping who (and if succesful), identify pain points, gather sentiment\\n- Clean & Enhance Data, Update docs, create bug reports\\n- RAG Knowledge: AI Agents giving automated responses to FAQ\\n\\nYou can now use [AI news](https://github.com/bozp-pzob/ai-news) to generate a summary, who helped who, FAQ, and action items analysis of a source for whatever time period you want - even historically!\\n\\n[![image](/blog/ainews.jpg)](/blog/ainews.jpg)\\n\\nWe retroactively reward people who provided good answers to questions (we\'re using tip.cc) over a time period. Later people can reuse their tips when helping or asking for help from other people.\\n\\n[![image](/blog/reward.jpg)](/blog/reward.jpg)\\n\\n**Main Lesson: Treat the docs as first-class citizen of your project.**\\n\\nEliza AI agent assistants helping devs with common questions about elizaOS greatly benefit from good docs to provide more current and accurate information, which speeds up onboarding and lets developers stay focused on higher impact activities.\\n\\n> Read [this guide](https://www.kapa.ai/blog/optimizing-technical-documentation-for-llms) on how to optimize technical docs for LLMs. Adding FAQ with answers in the docs enhances optimizes them for LLM use cases.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Get Involved\\n\\nIn the future I want people to be able to install Eliza and be greeted by an agent that can help you setup, configure settings, create plugins, deploy, etc. For now I think our assistants need to be supervised until we\'re confident enough in their responses. I think we can speed things up by having the agent admit what they don\'t know the answer vs hallucinating, and to guide devs to the main community support channels when they\'re having difficulty.\\n\\nIf you want to collaborate with us, here\'s a few ideas:\\n\\n- Answer people\'s questions in the coders / tech support channels on discord, it will get noticed :)\\n- Help with docs: go through pages, verify information with code, test the steps, create issues and PRs with fixes\\n- Collaborate with us on the [AI news aggregator](https://github.com/bozp-pzob/ai-news)\\n  - Generate new show ideas using the [output files](https://m3-org.github.io/ai-news/) from AI-news\\n  - Write a script that takes a week of daily logs and turns it into a newsletter or news show program\\n- Ingest docs into your Eliza agent as knowledge to onboard them then tinker with the character file to takee on a role in the DAO\\n  - Perhaps it can act as a scribe that summarizes chats\\n  - Lore keeper, community moderation, or social media marketer\\n\\n### Links\\n\\n- https://github.com/bozp-pzob/ai-news (aggregator tool)\\n  - https://m3-org.github.io/ai-news/ (data for elizaOS ecosystem)\\n- https://github.com/elizaOS/knowledge (for eliza RAG knowledge)\\n- https://www.kapa.ai/blog/optimizing-technical-documentation-for-llms\\n- https://x.com/dankvr/status/1884417610420474199 (update 1/28/25)\\n- https://x.com/dankvr/status/1880050455226827246 (update 1/16/25)"},{"id":"v1-v2","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/v1-v2","editUrl":"https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/tree/v2-develop/docs/blog/v1-v2.mdx","source":"@site/blog/v1-v2.mdx","title":"ElizaOS V2 - What\'s New","description":"A comprehensive guide to the changes and improvements in ElizaOS V2 compared to V1","date":"2025-03-22T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":false,"label":"Release","permalink":"/blog/tags/release","description":"Official release announcements"},{"inline":true,"label":"v2","permalink":"/blog/tags/v-2"},{"inline":true,"label":"architecture","permalink":"/blog/tags/architecture"},{"inline":true,"label":"features","permalink":"/blog/tags/features"},{"inline":true,"label":"upgrade","permalink":"/blog/tags/upgrade"}],"readingTime":4.14,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"jin","title":"Contributor","url":"https://github.com/madjin","socials":{"twitter":"https://twitter.com/dankvr","github":"https://github.com/madjin"},"imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32600939?v=4","key":"jin","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"v1-v2","title":"ElizaOS V2 - What\'s New","description":"A comprehensive guide to the changes and improvements in ElizaOS V2 compared to V1","authors":"jin","date":"2025-03-22T00:00:00.000Z","tags":["release","v2","architecture","features","upgrade"],"image":"/blog/v1-v2.jpg"},"unlisted":false,"lastUpdatedBy":"madjin","prevItem":{"title":"Tools for Taming Information","permalink":"/blog/taming-info"},"nextItem":{"title":"Reintroduction to elizaOS","permalink":"/blog/reintroduction"}},"content":"The newest version of [eliza](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza) represents significant upgrades from the previous version, offering a leaner, more flexible architecture for cross-platform agent interaction.

This idea, that an AI investment agent might outperform even the best venture investors, sparked something far bigger\u2014a living, open-source ecosystem at the intersection of AI and the Internet. Along the way, we\'ve built a vibrant community of researchers, builders, and visionaries.\\n\\nThis evolution accelerates our commitment to push the boundaries of AI-driven applications across the Internet. elizaOS will serve as the technical foundation for AI-driven economies, governance, and internet applications by championing the core principles of scalability, modularity, and interoperability in pursuit of an autonomous future.\\n\\n## Why elizaOS?\\n\\nArtificial intelligence has quickly evolved from a niche curiosity to a driving force in our daily lives, advancing toward more generalized capabilities at a remarkable pace. As AI becomes increasingly central to how we learn, work, and solve problems, the need for open collaboration and broad accessibility grows clearer.\\n\\nYet today, the trajectory of AI is largely dictated by a handful of **monolithic, centralized corporations**\u2014entities that operate behind closed doors, hoard models, and set the terms for how AI is deployed and who benefits from it. This concentration of power is dangerous. It leads to AI systems that serve corporate or state interests over the public good, reinforcing inequalities, limiting innovation, and keeping critical advancements out of the hands of those who need them most.\\n\\nBy ensuring AI remains a **shared resource**\u2014rooted in **transparent research, open-source innovation, and community-driven participation**\u2014we can break free from the control of centralized actors and guide AI\'s development toward outcomes that benefit everyone.\\n\\nWith elizaOS, we\'re building the infrastructure for this future\u2014an **open, decentralized, and scalable framework** that empowers AI agents to operate, coordinate, and drive meaningful progress across industries and communities. AI should not be a tool of the few; it should be a force for collective intelligence, autonomy, and shared prosperity.\\n\\n## What is elizaOS?\\n\\nAt its core, elizaOS is the [framework](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza) for agentic intelligence, built to power the next generation of AI-driven systems. It consists of 3 interconnected pillars:\\n\\n### The Eliza Framework \u2013 Open-Source AI Autonomy\\n\\nThe heart of elizaOS is the framework, a TypeScript-powered, open-source toolkit for building **persistent, adaptable, and interoperable AI agents**. Named after the pioneering 1966 ELIZA program by Joseph Weizenbaum\u2014which simulated human conversation through simple pattern matching\u2014the modern Eliza takes this concept to new heights: unlike static models, Eliza agents evolve over time\u2014carrying memories, context, and knowledge across different environments, enabling them to interact fluidly with each other and external applications.\\n\\nToday the Eliza Framework has:\\n\\n- **14.9K stars** and 4.8K forks of our core repository, reflecting massive developer adoption\\n- **500+ contributors** advancing the open-source ecosystem\\n- **100+ plugins** expanding functionality\\n\\nThe framework\'s growth is fueled by a collective vision: to create a decentralized intelligence network where AI agents are not just tools but genuine collaborators, executing complex tasks with efficiency, autonomy, and trust across domains.\\n\\n### AI-Enhanced Governance\\n\\nWe are pioneering a new era of truly autonomous DAOs. As AI agents achieve trustless coordination, AI-enhanced DAOs will seamlessly integrate them, unlocking new levels of decentralized autonomy.\\n\\nTo enable this, we are building AI-native governance primitives that progressively expand DAO capabilities. Over time, autonomous agents will be entrusted to manage funds, coordinate resources, onboard contributors, and orchestrate both human and machine capital. AI will act as a copilot for treasury management, contributor recruitment, and operational execution, while token holders provide strategic oversight.\\n\\nThis fusion of human intent and agent-driven action redefines decentralized governance, laying the foundation for self-evolving networks. Our open-source community is the first AIDAO\u2014an autonomous ecosystem where builders, thinkers, and agents collaborate as co-creators of a future assembling itself in real time.\\n\\n### Eliza Labs \u2013 R&D for the AI-Native Future\\n\\nEliza Labs is the research and development engine, dedicated to advancing the capabilities of elizaOS through cutting-edge AI techniques, proofs of concept, and real-world applications. It pioneers new agent-based projects while supporting open-source contributors via grants, accelerator programs, and ecosystem funding.\\n\\nSome of the major initiatives currently in development include:\\n\\n- **Eliza v2**: A next-gen upgrade introducing modularity, a radically improved AI model integration system, and a multi-agent architecture capable of seamless autonomous collaboration at scale. This will be the most powerful iteration of open-source agent frameworks to date.\\n\\n- **The Global Trust Marketplace**: A social-trading intelligence layer that combines AI-driven reputation scoring, trade validation, and decentralized execution. Integrated across multiple social platforms, it collects user-submitted trade calls and assesses credibility via a Trust Marketplace. Over time, it will evolve into a multi-instance system allowing groups to set their own risk parameters, manage DAO treasuries, and leverage customizable AI modules for enhanced investment strategies.\\n\\n- **AI-powered Token Launchpad**: A creator-friendly launchpad and no-code platform integrating multi-agent functionality, collaborative tokenomics, and AI-enhanced features. The launchpad enables both technical and non-technical users to seamlessly create and manage tokens and elizaOS agents. In addition, we are working with partners to deliver the best hosted agent experience with no limitations.\\n\\n- **DegenSpartanAI**: DegenSpartanAI is a crypto-native AI trading agent that blends sentiment analysis, trading strategy automation, and community engagement with a distinct, irreverent personality. Initially refining core trading strategies and its comedic brand, it will evolve into an interactive AI agent with real-time market insights, user-driven discussions, and NFT collaborations. Long-term, it aims to become a fully autonomous trading agent, integrating multi-platform execution, adaptive learning, and a verifiable track record within the Global Trust Marketplace.\\n\\n- **Eliza Studios**: A creative studio where AI meets art, storytelling, and digital experiences in a way never seen before. We\'re building autonomous characters, generative media experiments, and immersive AI-powered narratives that will redefine entertainment itself.\\n\\nBeyond these initiatives, Eliza Labs continues to refine multi-agent architectures, develop better coordination mechanisms, and explore integrations with an end goal to embed AI agents into the very fabric of digital economies, transforming how we govern, transact, research, and create.\\n\\n![](/blog/elizastudios.jpg)\\n\\n## The Coordination Layer of AI-Native Economies\\n\\nTo coordinate these three pillars, elizaOS uses the native token on Solana (HeLp6NuQkmYB4pYWo2zYs22mESHXPQYzXbB8n4V98jwC) to engineer a generative economic network. As elizaOS scales across platforms and industries, the token functions as both an index of the network and a conduit for collective growth.\\n\\nToday, the token serves as the coordination layer for research, development, and open-source innovation. As AI-native applications, marketplaces, and autonomous systems emerge around elizaOS, the token is evolving into the primary mechanism for capturing and redistributing the economic value they generate. While details will be unveiled in phases, some key areas of research and development include:\\n\\n- **Staking for ecosystem access** \u2013 Implementing mechanisms that allow users to stake tokens to access new partner tokens and enhance distribution for projects building on our framework.\\n- **Partner LP staking pools** \u2013 Creating liquidity pools where users can pair the native token alongside partner assets, driving liquidity and demand.\\n- **Core product integration** \u2013 Leveraging platforms like the Trust Marketplace, autofun, and Eliza Studios to amplify network effects, expand our native token treasury, and reinforce staking incentives.\\n- **Autonomous trading agents** \u2013 Deploying AI-driven trading agents to strategically acquire our native tokens and manage liquidity positions.\\n- **Expanded partner incentives** \u2013 Enhancing benefits for participants in the Partners program, increasing alignment and long-term engagement.\\n- **DAO-funded development** \u2013 Rewarding contributions and donations to the DAO, ensuring sustainable funding for the core framework\'s development.\\n\\nThe token underpins the economic infrastructure that links AI autonomy to the wealth of opportunities it unlocks. Many of our projects\u2014including the Trust Marketplace, token launchpad, and Eliza Studios\u2014directly contribute to the token\'s utility by driving network effects, transaction flows, and AI-native services.\\n\\nIn short, we intend to make the native token the base layer for the many applications and services built on top of our framework through mechanism design, ecosystem tooling, partnerships, and collaborations.\\n\\n## Our Vision of the Future\\n\\nThe internet began as a static archive\u2014a vast repository of human knowledge, waiting to be accessed. Then it became dynamic, social, algorithmic. Now, it is transforming again: into something intelligent.\\n\\nThis transformation isn\'t led by a single company\u2014it\'s emerging from an interconnected ecosystem of open protocols, decentralized incentives, and AI-native economies. This is why elizaOS is open-source, modular, and decentralized\u2014so no single entity controls it, and anyone can build upon it.\\n\\nThe agents we build today will form the foundation of a self-organizing intelligence that transcends industries, borders, and human limitations.\\n\\nA world where networks think, collaborate, and evolve alongside us.\\n\\nA world where intelligence itself is the fabric of the internet.\\n\\nThis is the world we are building.\\n\\nThis is the world of elizaOS.\\n\\n## Join the Movement\\n\\nelizaOS is no longer just an experiment\u2014it\'s a movement. If you\'re a builder, researcher, or visionary, now is the time to shape the future with us.\\n\\nContribute to the open-source Eliza Framework. Become a partner in the DAO. Build agentic applications across the web.\\n\\nelizaOS isn\'t just ours to create \u2014\\n\\n**elizaOS is YOURS.**\\n\\n![](/blog/yours.jpg)"},{"id":"/roadmap","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/roadmap","editUrl":"https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/tree/v2-develop/docs/blog/roadmap.md","source":"@site/blog/roadmap.md","title":"ElizaOS Vision","description":"Roadmap and product overview for ElizaOS including DegenSpartanAI, Autonomous Investor, and Agent Marketplace.","date":"2025-02-14T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"readingTime":6.08,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"ElizaOS Team","title":"Core Team","url":"https://github.com/elizaos","socials":{"twitter":"https://twitter.com/elizaOS","github":"https://github.com/elizaOS"},"imageURL":"https://github.com/elizaos.png","key":"team","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"ElizaOS Vision","description":"Roadmap and product overview for ElizaOS including DegenSpartanAI, Autonomous Investor, and Agent Marketplace.","authors":["team"],"date":"2025-02-14T00:00:00.000Z","slug":"/roadmap","sidebar_position":1},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Reintroduction to elizaOS","permalink":"/blog/reintroduction"},"nextItem":{"title":"What Did You Get Done This Week?

Investigate if we can provide an optional plugin registry after Eliza\u202fV2 (where the architecture cleanly separates \u201ccore vs. extension\u201d), enabling third\u2010party devs to add specialized capabilities to the Autonomous Investor without compromising stability.  \\n\\n---\\n\\n## Agent Marketplace\\n\\n### Overview\\n\\nThe Agent Marketplace is a next-generation token launchpad and a no-code platform for simple agents. It differentiates from existing platforms by integrating multi-agent functionality, collaborative tokenomics, and AI-enhanced features, enabling both technical and non-technical users to seamlessly create and manage tokens and ElizaOS agents.  \\n\\nWe\u2019re only sharing the short-term roadmap to maintain the flexibility needed to refine how agents x crypto merge into novel experiences. Launching the initial tokenomics-focused platform sets a strong foundation for continuous iteration, paving the way for long-term generative networks.\\n\\n### Short Term\\n\\n**MVP Launch:**\\n\\n- Complete the final audits on our custom-built LPing solution to ensure security and reliability.  \\n- Secure commitments from top-tier teams for our initial launch and ongoing collaborations.  \\n- Lock in remaining brand partnerships and key ecosystem alliances.  \\n- Release the tokenomics and product simultaneously at launch.  \\n\\n\\n![](/img/eliza-os_logo-mark_light.png)"},{"id":"wdygdtw-recap","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/wdygdtw-recap","editUrl":"https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/tree/v2-develop/docs/blog/wdygdtw_recap.mdx","source":"@site/blog/wdygdtw_recap.mdx","title":"What Did You Get Done This Week?

If you shipped something related to open source AI / social agents that week, you were allowed 1-2 minutes to share an update of what you have been working on. Thousands of listeners tuned every Friday night to essentially listen to a dev standup.\\n\\n{/* truncate */}\\n\\n![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Fd2lvapVsAAFvsG.jpg)\\n\\nThe WDYGDTW series played a role in establishing momentum and maintaining it throughout the formative months as the crypto x AI agent space was heating up. The weekly accountability structure encouraged:\\n\\n- **Rapid iteration cycles** from concept to implementation\\n- **Cross-pollination of ideas** between different teams\\n- **Public documentation** of the ecosystem\'s growth\\n- **Establishment of norms** around open development\\n- **Community reputation building** through consistent delivery\\n\\n## Timeline\\n\\nWe transcribed, summarized, and uplaoded notes for every Space shortly after each one. However, until now the recordings and notes haven\'t all been easily accessible all in one place. Showing up is half the battle. These are the pioneers of a grassroots crypto / AI movement.\\n\\n```\\n- Nov 15, 2024\\n- 1: Social Agents / Advancing towards AGI\\n    - Logan, Kyle (Raid Guild), Glue, Ropey, Loaf, Odilitime, SomewheresHe, Robin, IQ6900, Marvin, Dot, JW, Neo, Bloom, Reality Spiral, Jen, OFI, Butoshi, Doc (Geon Reborn), HCP, Garrett, Lady Liberty, BoyaLockser, Amy, Griffin, Frank (Heurist), Shaw, Tim\\n    -
