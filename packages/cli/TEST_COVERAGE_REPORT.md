# ElizaOS CLI Test Coverage Report

## Overview

This report documents the test coverage implementation for the ElizaOS CLI package.

## Current Status

### Test Coverage Summary

- **Total Commands**: 12
- **Commands with Tests**: 8 (67%)
- **Commands without Tests**: 4 (33%)

### Tested Commands ✅

1. **agent** - Complete test coverage including:

   - `agent list` - List all agents
   - `agent start` - Start an agent with character file
   - `agent stop` - Stop an agent
   - `agent logs` - Display agent logs
   - Helper functions and error handling

2. **start** - Partial test coverage (tests written but some failing):

   - Basic server start
   - Agent loading from project
   - Environment configuration
   - Error handling scenarios
   - Special modes (debug, SIGINT)

3. **create** - Complete test coverage
4. **setup-monorepo** - Complete test coverage
5. **plugins** - Partial test coverage
6. **test** - Test framework testing
7. **dev** - Development server tests
8. **env** - Environment variable management tests

### Commands without Tests ❌

1. **publish** - NPM publishing flow
2. **tee** - TEE operations
3. **stop** - Process termination
4. **update** - Package update flow (partial)

## Test Infrastructure

### Test Utilities

- **Location**: `test/helpers/command-test-utils.ts`
- **Features**:
  - Command mocking utilities
  - Test context setup/teardown
  - Mock server and runtime creation
  - Environment management

### Mock Strategy

- Comprehensive mocking for external dependencies:
  - File system operations
  - Network requests
  - Database connections
  - Process management
  - Console output

### Test Organization

## Running Tests

### Commands

```bash
# Run all tests
bun run test

# Run specific test file
bun run test test/commands/agent.test.ts

# Run with coverage
bun run test:coverage

# Watch mode
bun run test:watch
```

## Current Issues

### Start Command Tests

The start command tests are experiencing mocking issues:

- Mock functions are not being properly connected to the actual imports
- The start command assigns its own functions to server properties, overwriting mocks
- Need to investigate alternative mocking strategies or test approaches

### E2E Tests

Several E2E tests are failing due to:

- Outdated command options
- Missing built files
- Environment setup issues

## Coverage Targets

- **Target**: >90% code coverage
- **Current**: ~60% (estimated based on tested commands)

## Next Steps

1. **Fix Start Command Tests**:

   - Investigate vitest module mocking limitations
   - Consider using dependency injection for better testability
   - May need to refactor start command for better test isolation

2. **Complete Missing Tests**:

   - Implement tests for `publish` command
   - Implement tests for `tee` command
   - Implement tests for inline `stop` command
   - Complete `update` command tests

3. **Fix E2E Tests**:

   - Update command options to match current implementation
   - Ensure build process runs before E2E tests
   - Fix environment variable handling

4. **Improve Test Infrastructure**:
   - Add more test utilities for common scenarios
   - Improve mock management
   - Add performance benchmarks

## Best Practices

### Writing New Tests

1. Use the test utilities from `command-test-utils.ts`
2. Always clean up temporary files and restore environment
3. Mock external dependencies thoroughly
4. Test both success and error scenarios
5. Use descriptive test names

### Mocking Guidelines

1. Mock at the module level using `vi.mock()`
2. Reset mocks in `beforeEach` hooks
3. Restore original implementations in `afterEach`
4. Use `vi.fn()` for function mocks
5. Avoid mocking internal implementation details

## Maintenance

- Review and update tests when commands change
- Keep mock implementations in sync with real APIs
- Monitor test performance and optimize slow tests
- Regular coverage reports to track progress
