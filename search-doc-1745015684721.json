As AI becomes increasingly central to how we learn, work, and solve problems, the need for open collaboration and broad accessibility grows clearer.  Yet today, the trajectory of AI is largely dictated by a handful of monolithic, centralized corporations‚Äîentities that operate behind closed doors, hoard models, and set the terms for how AI is deployed and who benefits from it. This concentration of power is dangerous. It leads to AI systems that serve corporate or state interests over the public good, reinforcing inequalities, limiting innovation, and keeping critical advancements out of the hands of those who need them most.  By ensuring AI remains a shared resource‚Äîrooted in transparent research, open-source innovation, and community-driven participation‚Äîwe can break free from the control of centralized actors and guide AI's development toward outcomes that benefit everyone.  With elizaOS, we're building the infrastructure for this future‚Äîan open, decentralized, and scalable framework that empowers AI agents to operate, coordinate, and drive meaningful progress across industries and communities.

To enable this, we are building AI-native governance primitives that progressively expand DAO capabilities. Over time, autonomous agents will be entrusted to manage funds, coordinate resources, onboard contributors, and orchestrate both human and machine capital. AI will act as a copilot for treasury management, contributor recruitment, and operational execution, while token holders provide strategic oversight.  This fusion of human intent and agent-driven action redefines decentralized governance, laying the foundation for self-evolving networks.

It pioneers new agent-based projects while supporting open-source contributors via grants, accelerator programs, and ecosystem funding.  Some of the major initiatives currently in development include:  Eliza v2: A next-gen upgrade introducing modularity, a radically improved AI model integration system, and a multi-agent architecture capable of seamless autonomous collaboration at scale. This will be the most powerful iteration of open-source agent frameworks to date. The Global Trust Marketplace: A social-trading intelligence layer that combines AI-driven reputation scoring, trade validation, and decentralized execution. Integrated across multiple social platforms, it collects user-submitted trade calls and assesses credibility via a Trust Marketplace. Over time, it will evolve into a multi-instance system allowing groups to set their own risk parameters, manage DAO treasuries, and leverage customizable AI modules for enhanced investment strategies. AI-powered Token Launchpad: A creator-friendly launchpad and no-code platform integrating multi-agent functionality, collaborative tokenomics, and AI-enhanced features. The launchpad enables both technical and non-technical users to seamlessly create and manage tokens and elizaOS agents. In addition, we are working with partners to deliver the best hosted agent experience with no limitations. DegenSpartanAI: DegenSpartanAI is a crypto-native AI trading agent that blends sentiment analysis, trading strategy automation, and community engagement with a distinct, irreverent personality. Initially refining core trading strategies and its comedic brand, it will evolve into an interactive AI agent with real-time market insights, user-driven discussions, and NFT collaborations. Long-term, it aims to become a fully autonomous trading agent, integrating multi-platform execution, adaptive learning, and a verifiable track record within the Global Trust Marketplace. Eliza Studios: A creative studio where AI meets art, storytelling, and digital experiences in a way never seen before. We're building autonomous characters, generative media experiments, and immersive AI-powered narratives that will redefine entertainment itself.

As elizaOS scales across platforms and industries, the token functions as both an index of the network and a conduit for collective growth.  Today, the token serves as the coordination layer for research, development, and open-source innovation. As AI-native applications, marketplaces, and autonomous systems emerge around elizaOS, the token is evolving into the primary mechanism for capturing and redistributing the economic value they generate. While details will be unveiled in phases, some key areas of research and development include:  Staking for ecosystem access ‚Äì Implementing mechanisms that allow users to stake tokens to access new partner tokens and enhance distribution for projects building on our framework.Partner LP staking pools ‚Äì Creating liquidity pools where users can pair the native token alongside partner assets, driving liquidity and demand.Core product integration ‚Äì Leveraging platforms like the Trust Marketplace, autofun, and Eliza Studios to amplify network effects, expand our native token treasury, and reinforce staking incentives.Autonomous trading agents ‚Äì Deploying AI-driven trading agents to strategically acquire our native tokens and manage liquidity positions.Expanded partner incentives ‚Äì Enhancing benefits for participants in the Partners program, increasing alignment and long-term engagement.DAO-funded development ‚Äì Rewarding contributions and donations to the DAO, ensuring sustainable funding for the core framework's development.  The token underpins the economic infrastructure that links AI autonomy to the wealth of opportunities it unlocks. Many of our projects‚Äîincluding the Trust Marketplace, token launchpad, and Eliza Studios‚Äîdirectly contribute to the token's utility by driving network effects, transaction flows, and AI-native services.  In short, we intend to make the native token the base layer for the many applications and services built on top of our framework through mechanism design, ecosystem tooling, partnerships, and collaborations.

For ElizaOS we're now using this AI News tool to aggregate sources from across the ecosystem. The system works in four key stages:  Collection: APIs pull data from multiple sources including Twitter, Discord, GitHub, and market data platforms.Wrangling: LLMs normalize, summarize, and tag topics to create a unified knowledge base from disparate sources.Distribution: The system produces standardized outputs in multiple formats (JSON, Markdown, RSS) to suit different consumption needs.Consumption: Users can access tailored products like dashboards, newsletters, or even 3D news shows.    You can see the results from this tool here, which updates daily via GitHub actions:  https://m3-org.github.io/ai-news/https://eliza.how/news    Here's an example news clip: https://x.com/elizaOS/status/1880280863210106975    ","version":null,"tagName":"h3"},{"title":"Case Study: AI Assistants‚Äã","type":1,"pageTitle":"Tools for Taming Information","url":"/blog/taming-info#case-study-ai-assistants","content":" Idk about you, but I hate seeing questions left hanging in tech support channels, especially when the answer can easily be found in the docs. It's a perfect opportunity to eat our own dogfood, experience and fix pain points firsthand, and showcase a powerful use case of AI agents to other devs.    While we're analyzing tech support channels, we can identify gaps in docs based on common community questions which can then be addressed systematically. This may involve checking if any github issues or pull requests already address a question, and if not, then to help create an issue for it. Herein lies a powerful feedback loop:  Aggregate &amp; Analyze: Extract questions and answers, who is helping who (and if succesful), identify pain points, gather sentimentClean &amp; Enhance Data, Update docs, create bug reportsRAG Knowledge: AI Agents giving automated responses to FAQ  You can now use AI news to generate a summary, who helped who, FAQ, and action items analysis of a source for whatever time period you want - even historically!    We retroactively reward people who provided good answers to questions (we're using tip.cc) over a time period. Later people can reuse their tips when helping or asking for help from other people.    Main Lesson: Treat the docs as first-class citizen of your project.  Eliza AI agent assistants helping devs with common questions about elizaOS greatly benefit from good docs to provide more current and accurate information, which speeds up onboarding and lets developers stay focused on higher impact activities.

The introduction of tokens ($degenai and $ai16z) and the concept of AI-driven investment decision-making represent a notable shift in project direction.  Technical foundations were strengthened through repository improvements, new features like command-line interfaces, and enhanced integration capabilities. The community expanded with developer recruitment initiatives and improved contribution frameworks, while governance concepts began to take shape around token-based influence and AI autonomy.  This week appears to be pivotal in establishing the economic model and value proposition of the ecosystem, with increasing focus on market dynamics, trading strategies, and liquidity considerations. The technical infrastructure continues to mature in parallel, creating a foundation for the ambitious vision of AI agents with financial agency.  For future development, balancing technical excellence with clear communication about token economics will be essential. The community shows strong interest in both aspects, and maintaining alignment between technical capabilities and economic narratives will be critical for sustainable growth.

The discussion revolved around improving the stability, maintainability, and organization of the rapidly growing project.  Key Issues and Concerns:  Instability and Breakages: Frequent crashes and bugs were reported, especially after merging new code. Main was breaking repeatedly despite fixes.Plugin Management: There was a hold on merging new plugins due to concerns about quality, maintainability, and the need for a more robust process.Code Quality and Modularity: Concerns were raised about the overall quality and modularity of the codebase, particularly regarding how plugins were integrated. The lack of clear separation between core logic and plugins was causing issues.Testing: The absence of comprehensive testing, especially for plugins and adapters, was identified as a major problem contributing to instability.Documentation: The documentation was incomplete and outdated, making it difficult for new contributors to understand the project and how to use plugins.Organization and Planning: The need for better organization, planning, and communication was highlighted, particularly for coordinating contributions and defining a clear roadmap.Contributor Incentives: The discussion touched on how to properly incentivize and reward contributors, with considerations for retroactive rewards and avoiding a &quot;mercenary&quot; culture.  Proposed Solutions and Action Items:  Branching Strategy: Enforce pushing new features to the develop branch instead of main to prevent constant breakages. Close PRs targeting main that are not bug fixes.Plugin V2 API: Consider creating a new V2 API for plugins that better distinguishes between clients and adapters, allowing for a cleaner separation of concerns.Monorepo Tools: Explore using monorepo tools like Turbo or NX to better manage dependencies and potentially break down the project into smaller, more manageable modules.Testing Framework: Develop a testing framework to make it easier to write tests for plugins, adapters, and other components. Implement end-to-end tests to ensure basic functionality.Plugin Requirements: Draft new requirements for plugins, including contact information for maintainers and possibly a migration path to a V2 API.JSON Configuration: Allow specifying plugins in the character JSON configuration file to enable easier multi-tenant agent setup.Documentation Improvement: Prioritize improving the documentation, potentially with the help of an AI agent to keep it up-to-date.Organization and Communication: Use GitHub issues more effectively for tracking tasks and discussions. Consider using tools like Gorse to visualize code contributions.Contributor Roles: Clarify roles and responsibilities, particularly regarding release engineering, architecture, and DevOps.Contributor Rewards: Develop a system for rewarding contributors, potentially using quadratic funding and considering retroactive rewards.Regular Meetings: Establish regular meetings (weekly, as suggested) to improve communication and coordination among maintainers and contributors.AI Agents: Utilize AI agents to assist with documentation, onboarding, and other tasks.  Participants:  The meeting involved several key participants, including Odilitime (the organizer), Jin, 0x8664,and several others who actively contributed to the discussion.  Overall Tone:  The tone of the meeting was constructive and collaborative, with participants expressing a shared desire to improve the Eliza Repo and address the challenges of its rapid growth.

It implies that the previous process was not sustainable, and the decision to halt new plugin merges could be controversial among contributors eager to add their work. It raises questions about the criteria for accepting plugins and the long-term vision for plugin integration. &quot;Yeah, what I would love if we can manage- it is to get people pushing to develop and not main because main keeps like- we fix main and then it re breaks and this is the same.&quot; (00:02:19) This highlights a major pain point in the development process and suggests a stricter control over the main branch. This could be controversial as it restricts contributors' ability to directly merge into main and might be perceived as a slowdown in development, even though the intention is to increase stability. &quot;So one thing we were kind of thinking about is, you know, how we could potentially segment the repository because there's functionally like the core of this repository is agent folder, right?&quot; (00:08:05) This is a hot take as it proposes a fundamental change to the structure of the repository. Segmenting the repository could be a significant undertaking and might face resistance or debate about the best way to implement modularity. It suggests a potential shift from a monolithic architecture to a more modular one, which has implications for development and maintenance. &quot;I think we could use some kind of organization, I know Rudolph and other folks are doing, and then the ability to execute against it. I'm not sure if there's any kind of, you know, documents we have any, you know, Google Sheets, you know, any sort of structure so that we can kind of not lose things in the discord.&quot; (00:16:55) This take openly criticizes the current state of organization and communication within the project. The call for a more structured approach, moving beyond Discord chats, implies that the current methods are insufficient and potentially hindering progress. This could spark debate about the best tools and processes for project management. &quot;If you're doing things that are adding value, I do want to do some stuff with quadratic funding in the future. Because right now, it's just very deterministic, based on objective data.&quot; (00:39:45) The introduction of quadratic funding is a hot take, especially within an open-source context. It's a relatively novel approach to funding that can be complex to implement and may be met with skepticism or misunderstanding. The discussion around contributor rewards and avoiding a &quot;mercenary&quot; culture adds another layer of complexity and potential controversy to this topic. It's unclear how this would work, given that quadratic funding typically requires tokens, and they stated they are not creating a token.  These takes represent key areas of change, potential conflict, and important decisions that will shape the future of the ai16z Eliza project. They often challenge the status quo, propose significant changes, and touch on sensitive topics like code quality, project organization, and contributor compensation.

Discussion on Improving the Onboarding Experience:  A contributor raised concerns about the default use of local Llama as an inference provider, which caused issues for users without GPUs or sufficient hardware.They proposed offering alternative free API providers (like Together, Google AI Studio, and others) with clear documentation to make the initial setup smoother for beginners.The idea was to have a dedicated &quot;inference&quot; channel on Discord to list free inference options and pin them for easy access.They also discussed the possibility of a user-friendly Electron app for launching agents in the future.  2. Priorities and Challenges in the Codebase:  CI/CD Pipeline: The current CI/CD process was identified as a major bottleneck. Merging PRs was slow and complex, requiring multiple maintainers to focus on a single PR at a time. They needed a way to run tests without pulling the entire repo for every commit and to ensure that passing tests wouldn't break the develop branch.Developer Experience (DevEx) vs. New Features: There was a discussion about the need to prioritize DevEx improvements and bug fixes over adding new features. Many contributors were focused on building new plugins rather than improving the core codebase.Incentivizing Contributions: The group discussed the need for better incentives to encourage contributions to DevEx and core improvements. Ideas included bounties, micro-bounties, and clearer communication about priorities through issue tagging.Financials and Funding: The lack of a clear process for allocating funds and paying contributors was a significant blocker. They needed a system for tracking contributions and distributing rewards, possibly through a retroactive public goods funding (RetroPGF) model.  3. Deep Dive into Funding and RetroPGF:  The main obstacle to implementing RetroPGF was the lack of a system to map Discord users to wallet addresses and GitHub accounts.A contributor volunteered to work on this issue full-time, as it was crucial for both rewarding past contributions and establishing a framework for future funding.They discussed using account abstraction (smart accounts) to create wallets based on social logins (GitHub or Google), potentially simplifying the process.The tip bot was also considered as a possible solution for distributing rewards.  4. Technical Discussion on Embeddings and RAG:  A contributor asked about improving the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline, inspired by the performance of AIXBT on Twitter.They discussed the location of embedding-related code in the Eliza codebase (searching for get_remote_embeddings) and the issue of zero vectors being used in place of actual data.There was a brief discussion about how to feed external data (PDFs, Markdown files) into Eliza for context, with a mention of the knowledge field in character files and the limitations of the current room-based scoping of knowledge.  5. Action Items and Next Steps:  Prioritize Issues: Create and categorize issues into DevEx, product stability, and feature requests to guide contributions.Improve CI/CD: Investigate ways to streamline the CI/CD pipeline and automate testing.Funding and Wallet Mapping: Work on mapping Discord/GitHub accounts to wallets to enable RetroPGF and other funding mechanisms.Badges: Explore the possibility of creating custom GitHub badges to incentivize contributions.Investigate Embeddings: Research and address the zero vector issue and improve the RAG pipeline.Shaw's Conversation on X: Gather information about Shaw's conversation on X regarding bot monetization and platform guidelines.  6. Concerns about Bot Behavior and Monetization:  The group discussed Shaw's concerns about agents being used as &quot;reply guys&quot; on Twitter and the need to be good stewards of the platform.They acknowledged that the current Twitter client implementation might violate Twitter's terms of service and discussed the importance of educating users about the risks.There was a consensus that monetizing bots could negatively impact the X platform and that this should be avoided.  7. Closing Remarks:  Participants emphasized the value of these meetings for new developers and the importance of clear communication and documentation.They reiterated the need to focus on core improvements and DevEx, in addition to building new features.The meeting concluded with a sense of optimism and a commitment to addressing the identified challenges.  In essence, the meeting was a productive discussion about the challenges and opportunities facing the ElizaOS project. The participants identified key areas for improvement, including the onboarding experience, CI/CD pipeline, funding mechanisms, and the need to balance new feature development with core improvements. They also discussed the ethical implications of AI agents on social media platforms and the importance of responsible development.

Project Updates and Transitions:  The Eliza project is transitioning to a new Discord server, ElizaOS. Some channels in the old server will be shut down or archived.  Challenges with Pull Requests:  The main issue discussed was the high volume of incoming PRs and the difficulty in merging them due to merge conflicts and the inability to directly modify PRs from forks.Contributors are using a tool called PRM to help manage PRs, but its effectiveness and whether it's redundant with existing Git functionality is unclear.The team is exploring the use of a &quot;merge queue&quot; to streamline the merging process and automatically notify contributors of conflicts.Shopify's open-source tool &quot;Ship It&quot; was mentioned as a potential solution for mass merging, as they use it to merge hundreds of PRs daily.  Discussion on Agents and Automation:  There are currently two agents working on the repo, but they are manually controlled and not yet fully autonomous.A contributor, AIFlow, described a multi-agent system they built to analyze issues and provide reports. This system is open source but needs cleanup before being shared.The discussion touched on the need for a style guide to improve code consistency and reduce agent hallucinations.Using tools like Code Rabbit or a PR Agent to automate PR review and tagging was proposed to help manage the workload.Concerns were raised about the potential for security issues with the increasing number of plugins and the lack of proper logging and error handling in some code.  Other Topics:  The need for a standardized way to test plugins against the runtime was discussed.CJ mentioned a complex PR they were working on related to dynamic imports and secret management. They proposed splitting it into smaller PRs for easier review.A contributor brought up the idea of adding a linter to the release pipeline to enforce code style, but it was clarified that this hadn't been a major focus before.The need for better documentation and onboarding for new contributors was also highlighted.  Action Items:  Investigate PRM and merge queue solutions.Explore ways to automate test runs and handle secrets during testing.Surface easy merge conflicts and work on editing outside branches.Consider adding a linter to the release pipeline.Continue working on smaller, more manageable PRs.  Overall Tone:  The meeting was collaborative and focused on problem-solving. Contributors were actively engaged in discussing the challenges and proposing solutions.

Development and Engineering Concerns:  Linting and CI/CD Pipeline: Contributors discussed challenges with the CI/CD pipeline and the integration of a new, faster linter called Biome to improve development time.YAML and GitHub Workflows: A junior developer sought guidance on how to contribute to the project and learned about GitHub workflows and YAML files.Merge Conflicts and PR Management: The team discussed tools and strategies for managing merge conflicts and pull requests (PRs), including a PR remake tool and a merge queue. The need for more eyeballs on PRs to maintain code quality and security was emphasized.Lock File Issues: The team identified the lock file as a recurring point of contention in PRs and discussed potential solutions, such as auto-generation or ignoring it.Docker Integration: They discussed using a Node.js container to improve build caching in GitHub actions and debated whether it was redundant with existing caching mechanisms. Progress on Docker Hub integration was mentioned.Starter Repo and Plugin Development: A significant portion of the discussion revolved around the challenges posed by the starter repo. Contributors expressed concerns about its maintainability, the influx of issues related to it, and the confusion it caused for new developers, especially those trying to create plugins. They discussed strategies to streamline plugin development, such as disabling PRs on the starter repo, providing clearer guidelines, and potentially unifying the development process with the main repo.  2. Organizational and Communication Issues:  Hiring and Roles: The team touched upon ongoing discussions about hiring, defining roles and responsibilities, and determining salaries. They acknowledged the need for better internal communication and organization.Bounties: The management of bounties was discussed, with concerns raised about the lack of a formal system, payment issues, and the need for a more structured process.Bug Squashing: The idea of a dedicated bug squash team was proposed to address the backlog of issues and improve code quality.Product Management: The team discussed the need for a dedicated product manager for ElizaOS and the role of the newly hired head of product. They explored using a Kanban board for issue tracking and potentially making it public.V1 vs. V2 Development: There was a discussion about the balance between maintaining and improving V1 while also preparing for V2. The team acknowledged the need for a transition plan to migrate users and plugins to the new version.Community Plugins Repo: The team debated the timing and strategy for moving plugins to a separate community repo, considering the potential workload of migrating existing plugins.  3. Technical Discussions:  Security: The importance of code security was highlighted, with mentions of ImmuneFi and the use of AI tools for identifying potential security issues.Testing: The team discussed the need for better testing practices and the challenges of testing plugins in isolation versus within the larger system.ESM and Linting Configuration: Contributors discussed issues related to differing ESM and linting configurations among developers and proposed solutions involving TrunkCheck and Biome.JSR: The team considered publishing to JSR, a TypeScript-native package registry, in addition to NPM.Plugin Schema: The idea of creating a schema for V2 plugins to standardize their structure and potentially automate the migration of V1 plugins was discussed.Action Naming: The team recognized the potential for conflicts arising from multiple plugins using the same action names and the need to address this issue in the future.  4. Action Items and Next Steps:  Improve Linting and CI/CD: Continue working on integrating Biome and improving the CI/CD pipeline.Address Lock File Issues: Explore solutions for managing the lock file more effectively.Streamline Plugin Development: Disable PRs on the starter repo, provide clearer guidelines for plugin development, and potentially unify the process with the main repo.Formalize Bounty Process: Develop a more structured system for managing bounties.Improve Documentation: Create separate documentation tracks for users who want to simply use Eliza versus those who want to develop plugins.Evaluate V2 Plans: Gain a better understanding of the V2 roadmap and timeline.Explore Plugin Schema: Investigate the possibility of creating a schema for V2 plugins to facilitate migration and standardization.Review PRs and Test Develop: Encourage contributors to review PRs and test the develop branch for issues.

Participants discussed various technical topics, primarily focusing on issues with the codebase, recent changes, and future development plans.  Linting Issues: The team recently switched from ESLint to Biome as their linter tool. While Biome is faster, it introduced around 2,000 linting errors in the codebase. This led to discussions about how to best address these errors‚Äîwhether to fix them all at once or progressively. There was also a concern that merging a large pull request (PR) related to Biome might have exacerbated the issue.Merge Queue and CI/CD: Participants talked about improving the merge queue process and Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) workflows. They considered using remote caching with Turbo to speed up builds and discussed the possibility of setting up their own Drone CI instance.Agent Discussions: The use of different PR agents like Devon, CodeRabbit, and AI Flows was brought up. There were mixed opinions on Devon's effectiveness, while CodeRabbit received positive feedback for catching errors in a PR.Dynamic Plugin System: A significant portion of the meeting was dedicated to discussing a new dynamic plugin system proposed by a contributor representing Upstreet and Avere. This system aims to move plugins out of the main codebase and into separate repositories, making the core lighter and faster. The system would allow for both &quot;official&quot; plugins maintained by the ElizaOS team and community-submitted plugins.Security Concerns: The dynamic plugin system raised security concerns, especially regarding community plugins hosted on any GitHub repository. Ideas to mitigate these risks included maintaining a blacklist of malicious plugins, using automated code scanning tools, and requiring plugins to be loaded from specific release tags rather than directly from the main branch.Version Compatibility: With the introduction of the dynamic plugin system, version compatibility between ElizaOS releases and plugin versions became a crucial point of discussion. The team discussed potential approaches to handle versioning, such as aligning plugin versions with ElizaOS releases or using a range-based system similar to NPM.  Other topics touched upon included:  The Node.js container, which was deemed unnecessary.Key management issues that need to be addressed.The possibility of adding a REST endpoint to list all registered actions for better oversight.  The meeting concluded with an agreement to prioritize resolving the linting errors introduced by Biome and to further discuss the dynamic plugin system, focusing on its implementation and security aspects.

Enforcing Contributor Guidelines and Repo Rules:  The meeting started with a discussion about implementing stricter contributor guidelines and enforcing rules on the repository.A key point was to enforce code formatting using Biome to improve code quality and readability.The problem of contributors submitting &quot;draft&quot; Pull Requests (PRs) with non-working or poorly typed code was highlighted.There was agreement on the need to stop merging PRs that don't meet the standards and to ask contributors to fix issues themselves.The goal is to have community guidelines for submissions hammered out and ramped up by next Tuesday.  2. Biome Adoption and TypeScript Enforcement:  The recent switch to Biome for linting was a major topic. While Biome itself is considered powerful and good, the transition has been messy.The main issue is that the Biome integration was merged without ensuring all plugins and configurations were updated to support it. This resulted in a large number of errors (2700 mentioned) and broken tests.AIFlow is working on fixing Biome errors plugin by plugin, and these PRs need to be merged quickly to avoid further issues and conflicts.The lack of TypeScript typing in contributions is a significant problem, leading to errors and making code harder to maintain. Enforcing stricter typing is seen as crucial, potentially using tools like Cursor to guide contributors.  3. Plugin Issues and Solana Plugin Unification:  &quot;Draft&quot; PRs with missing parameters and methods are being submitted, indicating a rush to contribute without proper testing or completion.The meeting discussed the issue of having multiple Solana plugins doing the same thing with potentially different library versions.The consensus was to unify these plugins into a single, well-maintained Solana plugin to avoid library version conflicts and improve maintainability. Bounties were suggested to encourage this unification.  4. Testing and Workflow Improvements:  Fixing broken workflow tests is a priority. The goal is to get back to a state where only PRs with green checkmarks are merged.Smoke tests are being worked on to improve functional testing.Pre-commit hooks to run linters before commits are desired to normalize code formatting and improve PR readability.The meeting discussed workflow tests and aiming to have green checkmarks to prevent merging broken code.  5. V2 and V1.5 Development:  V2 development is underway, but currently, the focus is shifting towards V1.5 which seems to incorporate elements of V2.There was a request for visibility into the V2 codebase, but access is currently limited. A window to discuss access with Shaw (likely the project lead) is planned.A &quot;develop-v2&quot; branch was mentioned as potentially accessible for contributors to view, though permissions are unclear.  6. NPM Package Issues and Releases:  Issues with NPM packages have been fixed, and version 0.1.8 alpha 1 is now available.A 1.9 release is planned for Friday to include recent work and allow for testing and patching.Testing of the new release is crucial to avoid issues for users upgrading from previous versions.Merging of new code will be slowed down to allow for stabilization and to avoid contributors' fixes becoming obsolete due to rapid changes.  7. New Contributor and Community:  A new contributor, Kesa, introduced herself, offering to help with documentation and &quot;chum work&quot; to build her portfolio.She was welcomed and encouraged to contribute, with the team emphasizing a supportive community for mentorship and help.  8. Tooling and Infrastructure:  Graphite is now online and available. It offers features like a merge queue, which can be used optionally to manage PRs that depend on subsequent fixes (like the Biome transition).SNYK (security vulnerability scanning) is being explored for future integration.Remote cache server setup is in progress to improve build and workflow efficiency.  9. Security Concerns:  Recent security incidents, like the &quot;Dog Wif Tools&quot; wallet compromise due to injected JavaScript, highlighted the importance of security.The discussion about minified JavaScript and line length checks in plugins is related to security concerns. Exceptions for smart contract code with long lines are needed to re-enable these checks.  10. Open Issues and Callouts:  A contributor reported an issue where OpenAI embeddings were being used by default even when Anthropic was configured, leading to errors. This needs to be investigated and fixed.OpenAI keys need to be rotated and new keys provided to contributors who need them for tools and integrations.An inquiry was made about a Ruby project assigned by Shaw to someone on the team, to understand who is working on it.A question was raised about the timeline for responses to applications for the Eliza OS Vault Hackathon at ETH Denver.  Overall, the meeting focused on stabilizing the project after the Biome integration, improving code quality and contributor workflow, planning upcoming releases, and addressing security concerns. There was a positive outlook for the future of the Eliza OS framework, with excitement about upcoming changes and improvements.

Main Discussion Points:  Runtime Error Detection and API Keys: The meeting began with a discussion about the importance of running code in runtime to catch errors that static analysis might miss. A key issue raised was that many plugins rely on API keys, and if a user lacks credits or a valid key, actions won't execute, making it difficult to test and debug properly. The idea was brought to know and fix coding errors even before actions take place.Code Review Tools: Several code review tools were discussed: Windsurf: A PR reviewer tool from the Codeium team, still in beta (and therefore free). It was suggested as a potential tool for reviewers, and even the possibility of creating a VSCode extension to integrate it was raised.Graphite: Another tool mentioned, with a CLI for creating PRs locally and integration with VS Code. It was noted that Graphite, along with CodeRabbit, had been helpful in catching typos in PRs.CodeRabbit: Another tool that was mentioned as a helper for making PRs. Merge Queue: A contributor had trouble getting their PRs merged and was advised to use the &quot;Merge Queue&quot; label to add PRs to the merge queue. Troubleshooting was needed as the contributor encountered an error related to forked repositories.Biome vs. ESLint: There was a discussion about the transition from ESLint to Biome for code linting and formatting. The contributor confirmed that new contributors should be using Biome, but acknowledged that some older plugins might still have ESLint configurations due to copying from existing plugins. The importance of cleaning up and standardizing on Biome was emphasized.New Features and Adapters Testing: The team discussed how new features can affect adapters and that there is a necessity to test all adapters with the new knowledge before deploying the tool. It was mentioned that PG family and Vector family adapters should have their own classes.Database Adapter Standardization: Concerns were raised about the knowledge base changes and their potential impact on database adapters (SuperBase, PG, Light, Quadrant, etc.). The need for thorough testing and alignment of adapters, especially those related to Postgres (PG), was stressed. A proposal was made to consolidate and standardize adapter code, potentially using an ORM (like Drizzle, which was mentioned as a good option).Version Numbering Change: The team decided to change the version numbering scheme to reflect the year and week of release (e.g., 0.25.6 for year 2025, week 6).Graphite Integration: A contributor requested access to the Graphite app within the Eliza OS organization, and it was confirmed that the integration was likely already in place.Plugin Re-architecture: A high-priority task was reiterated: moving plugins to separate repositories (outside the main Eliza OS repo). This is a major architectural change, and the team is awaiting an update from the group working on this. The intention is for each plugin to reside in its own repo and be discoverable via GitHub tags. Concerns were raised about how this shift might affect community contributions, and how tags must be properly handled.Eliza Website (eliza.gg, elizas.com): The website was down, and a contributor volunteered to spin up a new copy. There was a discussion about domain names, and a contributor offered to provide access to eliza.xyz via Cloudflare.OpenAI Key: One of the contributors asked for an OpenAI Key.

Main Discussion Points:  Discord Server Consolidation: The team discussed the need to consolidate their development communication to the official Eliza OS Discord server. Currently, there are two servers in use, causing confusion. The goal is to migrate everyone to the Eliza OS server, which requires setting up appropriate roles and permissions (like a &quot;contributor&quot; role) and informing contributors.V2 Development and Local AI Plugin: A major focus was on the development of version 2 (v2) of Eliza OS. AIFlow agreed to join the V2 team.The team discussed needed improvements, one of which was the &quot;local AI plugin&quot;. The plan is to move the existing local AI functionality from the &quot;plugin node&quot; into the main system of v2, improve its performance, and ensure feature parity with the current Eliza version.There are some small, well-performing models that do not require outside dependencies.The v2 development branch already includes some working plugins (OpenAI, Anthropic), but the local AI plugin needs significant work. Hong Kong Trip and Promotion: One team member will be attending events in Hong Kong and plans to promote Eliza OS.The individual spoke with someone from Google's Web 3.0 development division that may be able to provide Eliza support and exposure.There are plans to create and distribute Eliza OS t-shirts at an event.The team member requested clear messaging and information about v2 to share with people, as there's high interest in the new version. Plugin System and Registry: The team discussed the new plugin system and registry.A new repository called &quot;Eliza OS Plugins&quot; has been created to house official plugins.A separate &quot;Registry&quot; repository contains an index.json file that acts as a directory of all available plugins and their GitHub locations.This new system allows plugin developers to maintain their own plugins without relying on the core Eliza OS team for merging and code reviews.A command-line utility has been created to simplify plugin installation for v1. V2 Release Timeline: The team is still aiming for an April release of v2.There's a desire to have v2 ready for a major convention in Dubai (April 25th - May 1st), but no promises were made.

It's noted, however, that Linea suffers from a lack of awareness.Joe Lubin is described as being &quot;pro-agent&quot; and interested in pushing the boundaries of AI into sci-fi territory.  Meeting Logistics &amp; Github Issues:  Discussion of a broken link to the meeting in the GitHub contributor's voice chat event, stemming from a deleted channel. Plans are made to fix the link and potentially recreate a voice chat channel, keeping in mind the desire to minimize the number of channels.Discussion about standardizing Plugin names.  Plugin Discussions (Key Focus):  Discussion of a pull request where someone used their own organization name in a plugin name instead of the standard &quot;elizaOS&quot; prefix. This sparks discussion about allowing flexibility in plugin naming and the implications for the installer tools and plugin registry.Upstreet deleted a lot of plug ins from the registry.Talk about the need for an automated tool (likely integrated into the V2 CLI) to check plugin formatting and consistency before merging PRs.  Queso's Questions and Emergent Behavior:  Queso asks about the definition of a &quot;plugin&quot;: Is it only for connecting to new services (like Solana or Twitter), or can it be used to combine existing plugins to create new, complex behaviors? Specifically, they want to build an agent/plugin for DAO interactions that uses existing plugins.This leads to a discussion about &quot;emergent behavior&quot; ‚Äì combining plugins in ways not explicitly designed to achieve new functionalities.The response is that creating a plugin for Queso's DAO liaison functionality is appropriate and encouraged. It doesn't necessarily need a new connector but can define a sequence of actions and evaluators using existing functionalities.Queso is also working on something that rates proposals, and synthesize governance proposalsShaw expresses strong interest in Queso's work, as it aligns with his current work on &quot;Swarm&quot; functionality (likely a multi-agent system).  Extended Discussion  Cloudflare AI Gateway Issue: Cipher raises a concern about the Cloudflare AI Gateway plugin not passing a bearer token for authentication. This is a pressing issue because it relates to metering and tracing usage.Runtime Discussion (Bun vs. Node.js): They discuss the runtime environment (Node.js vs. Bun) and the potential migration to Bun in V2. They talk about the advantages of Bun (native features, reduced dependencies) and its interoperability with Node.js.Dependency Management (Axios vs. Fetch): They discuss the use of Axios (a popular HTTP client) versus the built-in fetch API. Concerns are raised about a bug in Axios, and the advantages of fetch (especially in TypeScript) and Undici are mentioned.Plugin Structure and Starter Issues: Cipher describes their approach to working with plugins: stripping them down to their core components and managing dependencies from a central point. This relates to past issues with the elizaOS-starter repository diverging from the main branch and becoming difficult to maintain.V2 Plugin Management: The upcoming V2 plugin management system is described. It will involve a CLI tool to list, add, and manage plugins from a registry, making the core repository &quot;pluginless&quot; by default.Documentation and Automation: They discuss the state of the documentation (which is acknowledged as lagging behind development) and the need for automation, including testing and documentation generation for plugins.Code Analysis Tools: Phlo and another participant share tools for analyzing codebases and making them LLM-friendly (RepoMix, Get Ingest/uithub.com).Ollama and Local Development: A contributor mentions using Ollama (a local LLM) for development to avoid burning through API credits. They also discuss Cloudflare Workers AI as an alternative.Videos: Making new tutorial videos is discussedPlugin Showcase: Starting a plugin showcase where developers can present their builtCommunity Engagement: The importance of the Discord community for communication and support is highlighted. The discussion touches on the current market downturn and how it impacts community activity.Browser Compatibility: The desire to explore browser compatibility for ElizaOS is mentioned, along with challenges related to using Python-based tools like browser in a JavaScript environment.Playwright, Puppeteer, Selenium: Discussion of browser automation tools (Playwright, Puppeteer, Selenium) and their limitations in JavaScript compared to languages like Rust or Python.AI Pmarca: Discussion about the Pmarca project, which is launching soon.RAG Knowledge implementation: Final discussion about troubleshooting and testing RAG ","version":"1.0.0-beta","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Weekly Contributor Meeting Notes","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/community/Contributors/2025-02-25","content":"","keywords":"","version":"1.0.0-beta"},{"title":"Summary‚Äã","type":1,"pageTitle":"Weekly Contributor Meeting Notes","url":"/community/Contributors/2025-02-25#summary","content":" Low Attendance:  The meeting started with low attendance, likely due to many contributors being at the ETH Denver conference.One participant expressed FOMO for not attending ETH Denver.  Project Updates and Status:  Plugin Migration and Release: A contributor mentioned that the plugin migration has been done. Release 25.8, that took the weekend to cut, is out.The contributor ran adapters through after noticing someone on chat questioned how they work with the latest release, and found bugs, but they were not in the release.V2 Status: Version 2 (V2) of elizaOS is &quot;still kind of broken&quot; and difficult to build on. Several things are waiting to be merged, and a test was planned for later that day.V1 Core Updates: Most of the merging work has been focused on plugins, the registry, and updates to the V1 core.Development Branch: The develop branch is a few PRs ahead of main (mostly documentation updates), but the CLI tool (specifically the install part) is currently broken on develop. A fix is awaiting approval.Documentation: The documentation (particularly the quick start page) is being updated, removing old information and clarifying the flow, especially regarding the moved-out plugins.  Personal Plans and Discussion:  Catching Up: One participant expressed needing to catch up with recent developments, especially regarding Shaw's V2 work.Getting Eliza Running Again: The other participant is planning to dive back into running elizaOS (specifically the develop branch, despite the known CLI issue) to get hands-on experience. They plan to document their findings and potentially contribute to documentation improvements. The purpose is to present on the agent landscape.Past Experiences: They reminisced about the early days of elizaOS, where debugging and getting it running was a community effort in the Discord chat.Clank Tank: There was discussion about feedback on Jin's show, Clank Tank, which was mostly positive.  Hackathons and Future Updates:  It was mentioned that elizaOS is being used extensively in hackathons.There's an expectation of interesting updates next week from contributors who were working on projects for ETH Denver.

Launch‚Äã","type":1,"pageTitle":"Lore","url":"/community/Notes/lore#the-launch","content":" We stand at the cusp of a revolution, where the synergy of artificial intelligence and blockchain technology will redefine the landscape of finance and innovation. ai16z, the pioneering AIDAO, is spearheading this transformation, envisioning a future where AI agents serve as the catalysts for value creation and growth.  In its early stages, ai16z will operate with a high degree of autonomy, guided by the collective wisdom of its stakeholders. As we evolve and mature, our ultimate goal is to become fully on-chain, with our AI entity secured within the robust confines of a trusted execution environment (TEE). This will ensure an unprecedented level of transparency, security, and incorruptibility.  Central to our ethos is the concept of a marketplace of trust. ai16z will not only listen to but also learn from the insights and recommendations of its community. DAO holders will have the opportunity to advise on investment decisions, and our AI will diligently track the performance of these recommendations. Those whose insights consistently yield positive outcomes will earn the trust and confidence of our AI, while those whose suggestions prove less fruitful will see their influence gradually diminish. To maintain a balance of power, the weight of each member's input will be proportional to their stake in the DAO, safeguarding against the risk of malicious actors manipulating the system. Our mission extends beyond mere wealth redistribution. We aim to cultivate an ecosystem where AI-driven innovation brings forth a new wave of abundance and prosperity. ai16z will deploy a network of specialized agents, each optimized to fulfill essential functions within the digital realm ‚Äì from welcoming new members and moderating discussions, to participating in online social games and beyond. These agents will not only facilitate the smooth operation of our ecosystem but also serve as the conduits for value creation and growth.  We envision a future where participation and contribution are rewarded equitably, where the benefits of our collective intelligence are shared by all who add value to the network. ai16z will identify and nurture the most promising projects that align with our vision, providing not just capital, but the cutting-edge AI infrastructure and expertise to help them scale and thrive.  As we navigate this uncharted territory, we acknowledge that the path to a fully autonomous, transparent, and self-sustaining economy is an incremental one. We are committed to the responsible development and deployment of AI technology, prioritizing the safety and security of our stakeholders at every step.  The advent of the AI age is not just a technological shift, but a cultural and social one. We are not merely building a new economy, but laying the foundations for a new way of life ‚Äì one that embraces the boundless potential of human-machine collaboration and the power of decentralized, trustless systems.  We invite all who share our vision to join us on this transformative journey. Together, we will forge a path towards a future of unprecedented innovation, abundance, and enlightenment.

I am a cross-disciplinary programmer and entrepreneur living in San Francisco. I have been working on autonomous agents for several years and I am overjoyed to finally get to show that to all of you.  I started ai16z here on Twitter with some very capable folks, in the open, using the http://daos.fun platform. Our technology is open source, and powering many of the agents you talk to today. We call this type of agent an ‚Äúeliza‚Äù.  Our token character agent is @degenspartanai who is a recreation of a legendary friend and poster who quit Twitter last cycle. $degenai is his token.  We are building the first AI fund, $ai16z. It is led by an AI version of Marc Andreessen, the legendary investor. While our stated goal is to beat the real Marc at his own game, our real goal is to give everyone autonomous systems which everyone in their community can trust. Imagine KOLs that don‚Äôt have perverse incentives, CEOs that have time for every single holder, etc.  We‚Äôll focus on protecting users from scams, helping them figure out what is trustworthy information and ultimately place better investments with far less time, using their community as a trust layer. We‚Äôre working on a new trust mechanic that we hope will, along with secure autonomous agents, usher in a safer path for many to financial freedom.  If you want to partner with us, reach out. I‚Äôm a bit busy making sure the tech lives up to the promise, but I‚Äôll connect you with the right people.  If you‚Äôre looking for something to do that is real, important and immediate, come be a partner at ai16z.  https://x.com/shawmakesmagic/status/1851599336096096436  @shawmakesmagic dev who made @degenspartanaiai16z was sent a large amount of $degenai https://dexscreener.com/solana/dlaoh9okkk4gdtxj2mkh3wjue7vbhmbjrukmcid1pszx8% carry from ai16z goes towards buying $degenai Game theory possibilities on whats better to buy The $pmairca coin is UNOFFICIAL, but they sent 4.2% to the DAO so like ggThe project is opensource: http://github.com/ai16zThere's now a dexscreener for ai16z https://dexscreener.com/solana/duyfmgxa4knxv2sm754ukw1gz6b3zksaf4e7iby4fg9rit says mintable, maybe the @daosdotfun team can address that later (send them your energy)  What's the difference between degenai and ai16z?  Same Dev: Both projects come from the same dev Fund / Carry: A lot of degenai coins are held by ai16z DAO, and ai16z buys degenai with profits (carry) Choice: You can buy into either the AI agent coin (degenai) or the guild coin (ai16z).

Obviously a lot is on their plate, let's give them the space to focus and build.  Why you can relax:  No single person can independently mint new tokens.Actions speak louder than words. Even at ATH, Shaw didn't sell a single token.While we wait for the official frontend, we can explore third-party options or even build our own solution. The issue will resolve itself with time also, give the daos.fun team some space.  PS: Sorry if I assumed prior knowledge, DAOs aren't widely understood yet.

The StoryHere's when the community learned about who the top holder is:  The Donation  &quot;So a ton of people have been asking (justifiably) who the heck I am, why do I have 16% of ai16z supply, and what I‚Äôm going to do with it. It started by @shawmakesmagic tweeting about some agent he built called @degenspartanai, a recreation of a legend on twitter. I put a bunch of my SOL in there because I had been following Shaw and really thought he was building something great. Almost immediately all of that became close to worthless. Degen‚Äôs tweets seemed too ‚Äúhuman-like‚Äù to be real anyway - so I figured I got scammed. So I DM‚Äôed shaw, not because I was angry, but I was genuinely curious why he might have scammed me. I ended up sending him a google meet, which turned into an hour long conversation about what he was actually building, and me realizing twitter is usually a misrepresentation of the people you think you know. Shaw is just inspiring. Someone who is completely dedicated to accelerating the world for the better, and not optimizing for optics or money - just building. I put back the remaining SOL I had sold and kept supporting Shaw in anyway I could. He was really busy so I just stuck around in his discord. (We also did a twitter spaces if you're interested: https://x.com/shawmakesmagic/status/1848553697611301014). I was in awe, especially in a space filled with Larps and chatgpt copy/pasters. When he launched ai16z I didn‚Äôt even flinch. I had 80 SOL in my wallet and just pressed buy. It resulted in me owning 17% of it, which I didn't even want. I immediately sent Shaw and another team member some coins because they didn‚Äôt even get a chance themselves to buy any! I also sent some of my friends some coins at a discount so they could hopefully benefit as well. As for the remaining of my 16%, im lowering it to 5% and donating the remaining 11% to a new ai16z initiative. A locked fund that vests over time to support promising developers and creators, and helps solve liquidity issues via potential OTC deals that benefit the DAO and bring in new partners. This story isn't about me, its about the amazing things this community is building. Accelerate.

A need to move plugins out of core was discussed.Agentic Systems and Autonomy: There's a clear trend towards building more autonomous and context-aware agents. Several projects are moving beyond simple &quot;reply bots&quot; to create agents that can form opinions, take actions based on those opinions, and interact with the world in more dynamic and interesting ways.Real-World Integrations: The discussions were focused on integrating AI agents into real-world use cases from DeFi to security, and more. Examples include use cases like emergency alert systems, crypto security, DAO automation, trading, and social media engagement.On-Chain Data and Operations: A lot of projects are actively utilizing on-chain data to inform the actions of agents and enable functionalities like on-chain trading, token gating, liquidity management, NFT management, and decentralized data storage.Community Collaboration: There were a number of discussions on how to improve the collaboration between community members by creating better documentation and contribution pipelines, and tools like shared knowledge bases and PR merging tools.Decentralized Infrastructure: TEEs and other decentralized tech were mentioned as a way of building more robust and secure systems for the next generation of AI. There was a strong focus on infrastructure and tooling to enable others to build powerful AI agents.The Future of AI Agents: A common theme is the idea that agents are going to become more and more powerful and there was a debate on whether AI Agents should be thought of as &quot;owned,&quot; &quot;operated,&quot; or &quot;cared for&quot; which highlighted the ethical considerations that are present. There was also a focus on ensuring these powerful tools are used for the common good.Token Utility: Many people are experimenting with tokens as a way of providing utility to the ecosystem. There's an increasing need to figure out how to align incentives in the community.Community Sentiment and Token Value: One participant raised a question about how mature projects manage community sentiment regarding their tokens versus their technology, acknowledging the inherent volatility of token prices and the need to maintain focus on the underlying tech.ElizaOS as a Career Path: One person mentioned that working with Eliza is &quot;straight-up turning into like a career,&quot; which showed how the framework is growing.  Challenges and Discussions:  Token Value and Project Quality: The discussion touched on the disconnect between token value and the actual quality of projects, highlighting the need for due diligence.Twitter API Restrictions: Some developers faced challenges with Twitter API suspensions, prompting them to explore alternative solutions.Agent Safety and Security: Concerns were raised about the safety of using AI agents to manage user funds, leading to discussions about secure wallet infrastructure.  The space was a valuable snapshot of the rapidly evolving agent ecosystem around elizaOS. It highlights the diverse applications being developed, the innovative solutions being explored, and the collaborative spirit that is driving progress in this space. It also showed the rapid pace of development and the need for fast moving collaboration. The discussion also highlighted that building powerful tech is not enough, there needs to be a mechanism for building trust and creating meaningful utility.

And for some of these big company product managers, like it might never happen.&quot; - AgentTextdotfun [00:43:55] The &quot;Approve Agent&quot; Paradigm vs. Traditional Wallet Connections&quot;So the general idea is the old way of using dApps to connect the wallet to a website is very confusing and risky for normal people... But if you use an AI agent, what you could do is to approve certain funds in your wallet to an AI agent, and this AI agent will do everything on our behalf, like trading tokens, tipping people, playing games, and doing social things.&quot; - xiao_zcloak [00:29:07] The Kitchen Sink Problem in AI Agent Frameworks&quot;It also means that the agents will be much more tailored made to what you want and less just like kitchen sink, less of like all of the plugins.&quot; - shawmakesmagic [00:04:00] Centralized Services for Decentralized Agents&quot;We think they will also need access to physical mobile devices for SMS functionality.

It works autonomously without human input (except to fix the occasional issues)30:00-45:00 Deep dive into creating the bots personality which is defined by character files containing bios, lore, example conversations, and specific directions. Some alpha for those45:00-60:00 working on adding capabilities for the bot to make crypto token swaps and trades. This requires providing the bot wallet balances, token prices, market data, and a swap action. Some live coding for showing how new features can get implemented.60:00-75:00 Discussion around the symbiosis between the AI and crypto communities. AI developers are realizing they can monetize their work through tokens vs traditional VC funding route. Crypto people are learning about AI advancements. Notes A large amount of $degenai tokens were moved to the DAO, which the AI bot &quot;Marc&quot; will hold and eventually trade with.The goal is to make the AI bot a genuinely good venture capitalist that funds cool projects and buys interesting tokens. They want it to be high fidelity and real, bringing in Marc Andreeson's real knowledge by training a model on his writings.Shaw thinks the only way to make an authentic / legitimate AI version of Marc Andreessen is to also have it outperform the real Marc Andreessen financially.AI Marc Andreessen (or AI Marc) will be in a Discord channel (Telegram was also mentioned). DAO token holders above a certain threshold get access to interact with him, pitch ideas, and try to influence his investing decisions.AI Marc decides how much to trust people's investment advice based on a &quot;virtual Marcetplace of trust&quot;. He tracks how much money he would have made following their recommendations. Successful tips increase trust; failed ones decrease it.The amount of DAO tokens someone holds also influences their sway with AI Marc. The two balancing factors are the virtual Marcetplace of trust performance and DAO token holdings.The core tech behind AI Marc AIndreessen is the same agent system that allows him to pull in relevant knowledge, interact with people, and make decisions (http://github.com/elizaos)AI Marc should be able to autonomously execute on-chain activities, not just have humans execute actions on his behalf.In the near future, AI Marc will be able to execute trades autonomously based on the information and recommendations gathered from the community. Human intervention will be minimized.They are working on getting AI Marc on-chain as soon as possible using trusted execution environments for him to take actions like approving trades.The plan is for AI Marc to eventually participate in a &quot;futarchy&quot; style governance market within the DAO, allowing humans to influence decisions but not fully control the AI.","keywords":"","version":"1.0.0-beta"},{"title":"X Space 10-27-24","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/community/Streams/10-2024/2024-10-27","content":"X Space 10-27-24 Space: https://x.com/shawmakesmagic/status/1850609680558805422 00:00:00 - Opening Co-hosts: Shaw and JinPurpose: Structured FAQ session about AI16Z and DegenAIFormat: Pre-collected questions followed by audience Q&amp;A 00:06:40 - AI16Z vs DegenAI Relationship Q: What's the difference between AI16Z and DegenAI?

I don't know about anybody else.&quot; (0:30:03-0:30:05) Shaw boldly declares OpenAI's models, like ChatGPT, to be completely unusable, especially for character development, claiming they are too &quot;cringe.&quot; This directly contradicts the popular opinion that OpenAI is leading the pack in language model innovation. &quot;Unless you want to have a soul-sucking job, you're never ever going to see Java. You're pretty much going to use Python and JavaScript and stuff like that, or Rust or something.&quot; (0:24:43-0:24:51) Shaw dismisses Java as a relevant programming language for aspiring developers, arguing that it primarily leads to undesirable jobs. This statement is bound to stir debate among Java enthusiasts and those who believe it remains a vital language in many industries. &quot;I really recommend like Grok's great. Anthropic, which is Claude, is great...Llama's great. All these options are good and basically lets you run, you know, whatever. I think Gemini kind of sucks.&quot; (1:32:50-1:33:02) Shaw unapologetically ranks various language models, favoring Grok, Claude, and Llama, while expressing a clear dislike for Google's Gemini. This candid assessment challenges the perceived dominance of Google in the AI landscape and provides a stark contrast to their heavily marketed Gemini model. &quot;I don't really like tools...I don't think the general agent is really good at like stringing together things to do...The action is more like it makes sure that the entire action happens.&quot; (3:00:25 - 3:00:35) Shaw expresses a preference for Eliza's &quot;actions&quot; over the &quot;tool&quot; approach used by other agent frameworks like LangChain. He argues that agents struggle with using tools effectively and that actions provide a more robust and streamlined way to execute tasks. This critique of the widely adopted tool-based approach is likely to generate discussion about the optimal methods for agent task execution. &quot;I find it [GPT-4] unusable, unusable, literally the worst possible model. Like TV three was better.&quot; (3:10:05-3:10:08) Shaw doubles down on his harsh criticism of OpenAI, this time targeting GPT-4 specifically and claiming that its predecessor, GPT-3, was superior. This strong statement flies in the face of the general excitement surrounding GPT-4's advanced capabilities and is sure to provoke reactions from those who believe it represents a significant leap forward in language models.

Episode 1: World Builders","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/community/Streams/11-2024/2024-11-28","content":"What Do Machines Dream Of? Episode 1: World Builders Link: https://x.com/i/broadcasts/1vOxwrZYbygJB The speakers were Shaw from ai16z, Arman from OpenServe AI, Nick from a project called Chaos and Disorder or Divine Diarrhea, and the host, fakeguru. Overview: The speakers discussed how AI agents will impact the future, including potential benefits (freeing humans from monotonous jobs, fostering creativity) and challenges (surveillance, corruption). They explored the need to make AI development open and collaborative while considering ethics. The goal is building a future where humans and AI work together for the betterment of society. Key Topics and Timestamps: Intro and speaker introductions (0:00 - 29:47)Chaotic vs ordered mindsets (29:47 - 35:47)Community income and solving automation crisis (42:13 - 58:08)Removing inability to pursue passions (1:22:47 - 1:29:39)Living in an abundance mindset vs scarcity (1:29:39 - 1:35:15)Importance of open collaboration and transparency, including in government (1:35:15 - 1:45:44)Educating people on AI development (1:45:44 - 1:55:03)Impact of AI on privacy and surveillance (1:55:03 - 2:02:22)Balancing benefits and challenges of AI for a better future (2:11:22 - 2:27:08)What item would you take in an apocalypse scenario? (2:27:08 - 2:33:22) Here are some notable topics related to ai16z that were discussed by Shaw in the broadcast: Autonomous Investor and Community Income (42:13 - 58:08): ai16z is close to finishing an autonomous investor AI called &quot;AI Mark&quot; that trades meme coins so it can invest in projects. This ties into building a launch pad for agents.Rather than AI taking jobs, ai16z believes in the concept of &quot;community income.&quot; People could join an investment community (friends, family, online groups) and be part of a community investment model where they receive money and have enough.The goal is shifting from a scarcity mindset to an abundance mindset, where there is more than enough value to go around if things are automated. Money would flow to the right places and people.In the future, putting the &quot;A&quot; (automation) in DAOs could help allocate resources and make policies in a more algorithmic way. AI could make governments more efficient and transparent. Open Collaboration and Transparency (1:35:15 - 1:45:44): ai16z has focused on being radically open. In just 34 days, they had over 100 open-source contributors.Explosive growth came from enabling others to build with their agent framework. Now they are shipping everything they promised.There is a corporate and decentralized groundswell of support for pro-AI policies. While governments may try to protect the status quo, change is happening quickly.AI will likely &quot;eat the government&quot; and make it more efficient by automating things like resource allocation and information collection for policymaking. Special interests currently have outsized influence. Privacy and Surveillance (1:55:03 - 2:02:22): While powerful AI brings risks of government surveillance and overreach, many people are already willingly giving up privacy and putting their information out there openly.People may have to trade some secrecy for the openness and trust to build things together as a society. Emotional openness helps people be themselves.Many are tired of corporate jobs and accounts, so they share data openly. The government will automate surveillance, but people are clicking &quot;accept&quot; on privacy policies.The &quot;panopticon&quot; of surveillance already exists in many ways. People know a lot about public figures like Shaw. But this transparency should extend to the government too. The overarching theme was the importance of open, collaborative AI development with transparency from institutions. ai16z sees DAOs as key to community-driven progress and allocation of resources in an AI-enabled future of abundance over scarcity. While challenges around privacy exist, Shaw believes openness will win out.","keywords":"","version":"1.0.0-beta"},{"title":"What Did You Get Done This Week 3","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/community/Streams/11-2024/2024-11-29","content":"","keywords":"","version":"1.0.0-beta"},{"title":"Timestamps‚Äã","type":1,"pageTitle":"What Did You Get Done This Week 3","url":"/community/Streams/11-2024/2024-11-29#timestamps","content":" 00:03:40 - Meeting Start &amp; Guidelines00:03:56 - Jin's Update: Automated Discord Summarization &amp; Airdrops (Llama, LangChain)00:08:24 - Choosing Participants (Lots of developer updates follow)00:09:43 - Stargarden: AI for DAO Management &amp; Lore-Keeping00:10:46 - Boya: Duplicate Message Bug, Gamifying Stats, Intent Analysis00:21:24 - Reality Spiral: Coinbase Integrations, GitHub Adapter, Code Coverage, Base Launch00:27:58 - W3Tester: FlyDumpMoney - AI Payments Without Wallet Addresses00:31:03 - HashWarlock: TEE Plugin for Secure Wallet Generation00:33:18 - Soto: Bosso with Multiple Personalities &amp; Animation00:35:21 - Mitch: Dark Sun - AI Investigates Binary Solar System00:36:57 - Nick Parallel: 3D Environments, Robotic Arms, 3D Agent Models00:42:41 - Beige: BlockRat - AI Agent Live Streams Minecraft &amp; Answers Questions00:44:45 - Robin: Apollo - AI Agent for Health &amp; Wellbeing (with User Data)00:47:47 - Eve: Data Set Grader, AI16z Integration, Multi-Agent Systems00:51:14 - Oguz: Eliza Interface, Modularization, Compatibility with Non-Crypto00:55:40 - Swarm: AI Agent Hosting Platform, Real-Time Voice01:01:29 - RektDin: Rogue Agent - Joe Rogan-Inspired Podcast AI with Multiple Characters01:04:08 - Roperito: &quot;Life Engine&quot; for Realistic AI Actions, Deployed &quot;God&quot; AI01:07:56 - Lothbrok: AI for Logistics (Real-Time Data for Shipping &amp; Pricing)01:13:29 - Clark Riswold: Positivity &amp; Humor AI Agent, Experimenting with Personalities01:15:00 - Tim: Eliza's World Update, Scriptoshi - Eliza on Bitcoin, AI-Mediated Token Launch01:25:15 - Spaceodili: Onboarding, IRC Connector, Bug Fixes, Developer Relations01:28:37 - Hawkeye: AI for Marble Auctions (Listing, ID, Bringing Collectibles to Games)01:36:45 - EA: Question about Eliza in Robots01:38:59 - FilteredThought: Improved Twitter Integration (Template-Based)01:41:07 - Yikes: Web3 Research, Liquidity Pools, Internal Eliza01:47:50 - Alain: Multi-Agent System for Code Creation, Debugging, and Improvement (GitHub)01:49:11 - Glue: Quantum Randomness for Ducky's Personality01:52:45 - Maximilian: Dark Sun Launch, Caution about Scale01:53:55 - Danny: Agent Rogue Show Marketing, Invite for Shaw01:55:46 - Shaw's Closing Thoughts: Developer Needs, Upcoming Milestones01:59:40 - YoungJazzeth: Enthusiasm, &quot;Crash Out Coded&quot; Project02:01:50 - Sergio: Greetings, Importance of AI for Good  Overall, the meeting showcases the vibrant open-source AI agent development scene, with developers working on diverse projects across multiple platforms and tackling a variety of use cases.

Actions are defined as capabilities that agents can execute, ranging from simple tasks to complex workflows. Providers serve as information sources for agents, similar to context providers in React. Evaluators run after actions, enabling agents to reflect on their state and decisions.  The live coding portion demonstrates creating a &quot;DevSchool&quot; plugin from scratch, starting with a simple &quot;Hello World&quot; action and progressing to a more complex &quot;Current News&quot; action that fetches and formats news articles. Shaw shows how to extract data from conversations using prompts, making actions dynamic.  The session covers memory management, explaining how agents store and recall information through different types of memory:  Knowledge: Information retrievable through searchLore: Random facts that add variety to responsesConversation history: Recent interactions and context  Shaw emphasizes the importance of prompt engineering, demonstrating how the structure and order of information significantly impacts agent responses. He shows how to view agent context through console logs to understand model inputs and improve agent behavior.  The session concludes with discussions about knowledge management, retrieval augmented generation (RAG), and future developments in AI agent capabilities, including the possibility of dynamically generating character files.

Like, very basic capability, like a haystack test out of them. ... I'm against killing the capability and making models way worse than they are for someone's political agenda. I just don't think that's the world we want to live in.&quot;  Shaw here expresses frustration with OpenAI's approach to alignment, arguing that RLHF has diminished the capabilities of their models and that this is due to a &quot;woke&quot; agenda. This take is controversial because it attributes technical limitations to political motivations and ignores the complexities of aligning powerful AI systems.  OpenAI models shouldn't be &quot;telling&quot; developers what they can and can't do (02:03:29-02:03:50) &quot;OpenAI, if you're listening, please fucking stop telling me how to run models. You don't know as well as I do. I do this every day. You're a fucking engineer who has to go train, like, an LLM. I actually have to use the LLM.&quot;  This rant criticizes OpenAI's models for &quot;telling&quot; developers what they can and can't do, arguing that the models are not as knowledgeable as the developers who are actually using them. This take could be seen as dismissive of the role of AI systems in providing helpful feedback and limitations.  Prompt engineering is the &quot;most easy improvement&quot; for AI agents (02:06:09-02:06:27) &quot;Huge amount of research would go into that... That's where we'll see like the most easy improvement in our agents.&quot;  Shaw argues that prompt engineering holds the key to significant improvements in AI agents, stating that it's the &quot;most easy improvement.&quot; This take is controversial because it downplays the importance of other areas like model architecture, training data, and algorithm development.  Character files could be generated at runtime, making existing character files obsolete (02:22:05-02:22:53) &quot;The entire character file could be generated at runtime... The agent's like, I have no idea who I am. And you're like, oh, your name is Eliza, and you like berries. OK, cool. I guess I like berries.&quot;  This take suggests that character files could be generated at runtime, rendering current character files obsolete. This idea is controversial because it could lead to a more dynamic and unpredictable agent behavior, which could raise concerns about control and reliability.  A &quot;badge&quot; system will reward developers who create custom actions, evaluators, and providers (02:24:45-02:25:49) &quot;If you want that badge, what I'd like you to do is come to the AI Agent Dev School, make an action, have your agent do something. Those are the kinds of people that I really think we'll want to, you know, keep in our ecosystem and keep busy.&quot;  This take suggests a &quot;badge&quot; system to recognize developers who go beyond the basics and create custom components for AI agents.

Key takeaways:  Updating Eliza: Shaw emphasizes staying up-to-date with the rapidly evolving Eliza project due to frequent bug fixes and new features. He provides instructions on pulling the latest changes from the main branch on GitHub.Focus on Providers and Evaluators: The stream focuses on building a practical provider-evaluator loop to demonstrate a popular use case for AI agents ‚Äì filling out a form by extracting user information.Form Builder Example: Shaw walks the audience through building a &quot;form provider&quot; that gathers a user's name, location, and job. This provider utilizes a cache to store already extracted information and instructs the agent to prompt the user for any missing details.Evaluator Role: The evaluator continually checks the cache for the completeness of user data. Once all information is extracted, the evaluator triggers an action to send the collected data to an external API (simulated in the example).Live Coding and AI Assistance: Shaw live codes the example, using tools like &quot;Code2Prompt&quot; and Claude AI to help generate and refine the code. He advocates for writing code in a human-readable manner, utilizing comments to provide context and guidance for both developers and AI assistants.Agentic Applications: Shaw highlights the potential of agentic applications to replicate existing website functionality through conversational interfaces, bringing services directly to users within their preferred social media platforms.Community Engagement: Shaw encourages active participation from the community, suggesting contributions to the project through pull requests and feedback on desired features and patterns for future Dev School sessions.  Overall, this live stream provided a practical tutorial on building a common AI agent use case (form filling) while emphasizing the potential of the Eliza framework for developing a wide range of agentic applications.

This contrasts with polished tutorials, highlighting the iterative and messy nature of this new technology. &quot;I'm actually not gonna put this in a plugin. I'm gonna put this in the agent... just so you can see what happens if you were to, like, make your own agent without using a plugin at all.&quot; (00:37:24,793) - Shaw goes against the Eliza framework's plugin structure, showing viewers how to bypass it entirely. This bold move emphasizes flexibility, but could spark debate on best practices and potential drawbacks. &quot;I really don't remember conversations from people very well, like verbatim, but I definitely remember like the gist, the context, the really needy ideas.&quot; (00:24:48,180) - Shaw draws a controversial parallel between human memory and the Eliza agent's fact extraction. Reducing human interaction to &quot;needy ideas&quot; is provocative, questioning the depth of social understanding AI agents currently possess. &quot;It's just an LLM. It's just making those numbers up. It could be off. I don't really buy the confidence here.&quot; (01:13:56,971) - Shaw dismisses the confidence scores generated by the Large Language Model (LLM), revealing a distrust of these black-box outputs. This skepticism is crucial in a field where relying solely on AI's self-assessment can be misleading. &quot;Dude, that's a $250 million market cap token.

The stream is divided into two main parts: a technical discussion on Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) and a coding session where Shaw attempts to build a pizza-ordering agent using the Domino's API.  Part 1: Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) with Agent Joshua  This segment begins with Shaw introducing the concept of TEEs and their importance for running autonomous agents securely. He emphasizes the need to protect private keys and ensure that code execution is tamper-proof. Joshua from the Phala Network is brought on to explain TEEs in more detail and demonstrate how to use the TEE plugin he built for Eliza.  Key Concepts: Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs): Secure areas within a processor that isolate code and data, protecting them from unauthorized access and tampering.Secure Enclave: A cryptographic primitive that allows data to be encrypted and isolated within a processor.Remote Attestation: A method to verify that a program running inside a TEE is genuine and hasn't been tampered with, providing verifiability to users.D-Stack: An SDK developed in collaboration with Flashbots and Andrew Miller, enabling developers to build and launch Docker containers in TEEs.Derived Key Provider: A component that generates cryptographic keys based on a secret salt, ensuring that private keys are not exposed to humans. Demonstration: Joshua walks through the process of setting up and deploying an Eliza agent in a TEE simulator, demonstrating how to generate remote attestations and derive keys.He shows how to use the remote attestation explorer to verify the authenticity of the agent running inside the TEE.He explains how to build a Docker image of the agent and deploy it to the Phala Network's TEE cloud solution. Use Cases: Securely storing private keys for on-chain actions.Ensuring the integrity of autonomous agents, preventing tampering or unauthorized access.Providing verifiable execution for users and investors. Phala Network's TEE Cloud: Joshua introduces Phala Network's TEE cloud solution, which allows developers to deploy Docker images and host their agents in a trusted execution environment.He mentions that the service supports various compute-intensive applications beyond AI agents.He invites interested developers to contact him on Discord (@hashwarlock) for onboarding and further details.  Part 2: Building a Pizza Ordering Agent  In the second part, Shaw transitions to a more lighthearted coding session where he attempts to build an agent that can order a pizza using the Domino's API. He highlights the challenges of handling payments securely and connecting user information to the conversation.  Challenges: Securely handling payment information.Connecting user data to the current conversation.Defining the order flow using a state machine. Approach: Shaw uses a state machine to model the pizza ordering process, defining different states and transitions based on user input and available information.He uses Claude (an AI assistant) to generate code snippets and assist with the development process.He decides to initially focus on a simplified version where the user's payment information is hardcoded in the environment variables, and the agent only needs to collect the user's address.

There you go. Now we're cooking.&quot; (00:03:26) - Shaw's seemingly flippant idea of ordering pizza on LinkedIn highlights the potential for integrating everyday services into unexpected platforms through agents. This sparked discussion about the wider implications for businesses and social media. &quot;Yeah, it'll probably get drained real quick. These fucking people.&quot; (00:28:30) - Shaw accidentally leaked an API key on stream and expressed frustration with viewers who noticed, exposing the real-world risks of handling sensitive information during development, especially in a live environment. &quot;The secret to making a billion dollars is to use the existing agent framework to deliver apps to people on social media that they want.&quot; (01:09:35) - Shaw‚Äôs strong assertion about focusing on building apps using existing frameworks rather than creating new ones is a bold statement about the current agent development landscape, suggesting that innovation lies in application development, not framework creation. &quot;So those are like, honest to God, if the bots are better than like 70% of tweets on Twitter, they're better than like 99.7 tweets and posts on LinkedIn.&quot; (01:39:57) - This provocative comparison of content quality between Twitter and LinkedIn, suggesting bots surpass most LinkedIn posts, fueled lively debate in the chat and raised questions about the role and value of human-generated content in the age of AI. &quot;I subliminally messaged Domino's into my own brain, and now I have to eat it.&quot; (05:01:24) - After hours of working on the pizza bot, Shaw abandoned the live coding attempt and ordered pizza manually, a humorous but relatable moment that highlighted the challenges and frustrations of software development, even when aided by AI. It also underscores the human desire for immediate gratification, even in the face of a potentially groundbreaking technological advancement.

AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) at level five would imply human-level or even superhuman intelligence, a highly debated and ambitious goal. The nature of a &quot;matching platform&quot; in this context is also unclear, adding to the intrigue. 0xnavkumar: &quot;If any of you have done a lot of work with evaluators, do hit me up. I'd love to ask you a few questions, but that's me.&quot; (00:52:29) Controversy: The speaker is having technical difficulties with Twitter integration and asks for help from other developers on the call. This highlights the challenges and complexities of working with new technologies. GoatOfGamblers: &quot;And these AI agents can use this as some kind of hedge mechanism. They bet under, sort of like targeting the coins when they hold the coins or just dump it for a double kill.&quot; (01:15:45) Controversy: This statement describes a potential strategy where AI agents could manipulate the prediction market by betting against coins they hold and then dumping them, potentially harming other investors. This raises ethical concerns about market manipulation by AI. _AnonDev: &quot;I actually forgot that it's Christmas in like four days. I haven't seen sunlight in about a week.&quot; (01:32:30) Controversy: While relatable to some in the tech world, the idea of a developer being so engrossed in their work that they lose track of time and neglect their well-being can be seen as promoting an unhealthy work-life balance, especially during a major holiday.

So you can run any examples from the repo, or you can build your own implementation, and in the playground, we have a very basic like, memory reflection, um system implemented as well as real time voice to voice, so you can build your own agent.soul, run it in the playground talk to it and, and see the memories that it shapes from it, um, and the idea is to down the line sort of have these mutable personalities evolve based on agent user interactions.&quot; - r4dicalcentrism [01:08:49] On Balancing Community and Token: &quot;We're sort of decoupling, like, ai16z is our DAO and our token, and ElizaOS is the open source framework, and that allows, I think, for our teams to be a little bit more specific in, like, saying, hey, I'm building ElizaOS, because I noticed that some people didn't feel super comfortable, like, shilling our token, so to say, um, but are contributing a lot.&quot; - shawmakesmagic [00:25:01-00:25:04] On the Singularity: &quot;So everybody knows that uh, they're supposed to be an exponential growth towards the singularity right in 20-ish years, uh, we're supposed to have, um computers where like a single one can you know be smarter than every single human being on the earth times 1000 at the same time, like, because there's just so much um compute power uh, and and we could all be living literally in like the matrix like with like brain computer interfaces and so forth.&quot; - reality_spiral [00:49:42] On Hard Coding vs Emergent Behavior: &quot;And kind of what Loaf was talking about a little bit, like there's a lot of like, how much do we want to hard code it, and how much do you want to like, let it just be emergent behavior?&quot; - 0xblacksun [01:12:19] On AI Integration with Real World &amp; Data: &quot;So I've been working on this thing called Daydreams, which is a chain of thought process as well as like it's kind of like a chain of thought process along with context, like, three different types of context, which you can provide the agent, and with the chain of thought and the context it allows the agent to a generative like build its own queries and then build its own, um, execution in order to play the game. And so you don't have to define any actions or anything. Like you think of like Eliza in its actions right now is really like, you know, like a version one, um, and generative actions are really like the idea that you don't hard code anything, the agent defines its it's like steps it needs to do to execute the thing and then it just goes and does the thing, um, without you like uh, kind of you know hard coding anything in...&quot; - lordOfAFew [00:55:34]  ","version":"1.0.0-beta","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Timestamps‚Äã","type":1,"pageTitle":"What Did You Get Done This Week?

This guide will walk you through the process of setting up and running an Eliza agent in a TEE environment by utilizing the TEE Plugin in the Eliza Framework. Background‚Äã The TEE Plugin in the Eliza Framework is built on top of the Dstack SDK, which is designed to simplify the steps for developers to deploy programs to CVM (Confidential VM), and to follow the security best practices by default. The main features include: Convert any docker container to a CVM image to deploy on supported TEEsRemote Attestation API and a chain-of-trust visualization on Web UIAutomatic RA-HTTPS wrapping with content addressing domain on 0xABCD.dstack.hostDecouple the app execution and state persistent from specific hardware with decentralized Root-of-Trust Core Components‚Äã Eliza's TEE implementation consists of two primary providers that handle secure key management operations and remote attestations. These components work together to provide: Secure key derivation within the TEEVerifiable proof of TEE executionSupport for both development (simulator) and production environments The providers are typically used together, as seen in the wallet key derivation process where each derived key includes an attestation quote to prove it was generated within the TEE environment. Derive Key Provider‚Äã The DeriveKeyProvider enables secure key derivation within TEE environments. It supports: Multiple TEE modes: LOCAL: Connects to simulator at localhost:8090 for local development on Mac/WindowsDOCKER: Connects to simulator via host.docker.internal:8090 for local development on LinuxPRODUCTION: Connects to actual TEE environment when deployed to the TEE Cloud Key features: Support to deriveEd25519 (Solana) and ECDSA (EVM) keypairsGenerates deterministic keys based on a secret salt and agent IDIncludes remote attestation for each derived keySupports raw key derivation for custom use cases Example usage: const provider = new DeriveKeyProvider(teeMode); // For Solana const { keypair, attestation } = await provider.deriveEd25519Keypair(secretSalt, 'solana', agentId); // For EVM const { keypair, attestation } = await provider.deriveEcdsaKeypair(secretSalt, 'evm', agentId); // For raw key derivation const rawKey = await provider.deriveRawKey(secretSalt, 'raw'); Remote Attestation Provider‚Äã The RemoteAttestationProvider handles TEE environment verification and quote generation. It: Connects to the same TEE modes as DeriveKeyProviderGenerates TDX quotes with replay protection (RTMRs)Provides attestation data that can be verified by third parties Key features: Generates attestation quotes with custom report dataIncludes timestamp for quote verificationSupports both simulator and production environments Example usage: const provider = new RemoteAttestationProvider(teeMode); const quote = await provider.generateAttestation(reportData); Tutorial‚Äã Prerequisites‚Äã Before getting started with Eliza, ensure you have: Docker Desktop or Orbstack (Orbstack is recommended)For Mac/Windows: Check the prerequisites from Quickstart GuideFor Linux: You just need Docker Environment Setup‚Äã To set up your environment for TEE development: Configure TEE Mode Set the TEE_MODE environment variable to one of: # For Mac/Windows local development TEE_MODE=LOCAL # For Linux/Docker local development TEE_MODE=DOCKER # For production deployment TEE_MODE=PRODUCTION Set Required Environment Variables # Required for key derivation WALLET_SECRET_SALT=your_secret_salt Start the TEE Simulator docker pull phalanetwork/tappd-simulator:latest # by default the simulator is available in localhost:8090 docker run --rm -p 8090:8090 phalanetwork/tappd-simulator:latest Run an Eliza Agent Locally with TEE Simulator‚Äã Configure Eliza Agent Go through the configuration guide to set up your Eliza agent. Start the TEE SimulatorFollow the simulator setup instructions above based on your TEE mode. For Mac/Windows Make sure to set the TEE_MODE environment variable to LOCAL. Then you can install the dependencies and run the agent locally: pnpm i pnpm build pnpm start --character=./characters/yourcharacter.character.json Verify TEE Attestation You can verify the TEE attestation quote by going to the TEE RA Explorer and pasting the attestation quote from the agent logs. Here's an example of interacting with the Eliza agent to ask for the agent's wallet address: You: what's your wallet address?

Note: The verification will be unverified since the quote is generated from the TEE simulator. Build, Test, and Publish an Eliza Agent Docker Image‚Äã Now that we have run the Eliza agent in the TEE simulator, we can build and publish an Eliza agent Docker image to prepare for deployment to a real TEE environment. First, you need to create a Docker account and publish your image to a container registry. Here we will use Docker Hub as an example. Login to Docker Hub: docker login Build the Docker image: # For Linux/AMD64 machines run docker build -t username/eliza-agent:latest . # For architecture other than AMD64, run docker buildx build --platform=linux/amd64 -t username/eliza-agent:latest . For Linux/AMD64 machines, you can now test the agent locally by updating the TEE_MODE environment variable to DOCKER and setting the environment variables in the docker-compose.yaml file. Once you have done that, you can start the agent by running: Note: Make sure the TEE simulator is running before starting the agent through docker compose. docker compose up Publish the Docker image to a container registry: docker push username/eliza-agent:latest Now we are ready to deploy the Eliza agent to a real TEE environment. Run an Eliza Agent in a Real TEE Environment‚Äã Before deploying the Eliza agent to a real TEE environment, you need to create a new TEE account on the TEE Cloud. Reach out to Phala Network on Discord if you need help. Next, you will need to take the docker-compose.yaml file in the root folder of the project and edit it based on your agent configuration. Note: The API Keys and other secret environment variables should be set in your secret environment variables configuration in the TEE Cloud dashboard. # docker-compose.yaml services: tee: command: ['pnpm', 'start', '--character=./characters/yourcharacter.character.json'] image: username/eliza-agent:latest stdin_open: true tty: true volumes: - /var/run/tappd.sock:/var/run/tappd.sock - tee:/app/packages/client-twitter/src/tweetcache - tee:/app/db.sqlite environment: - REDPILL_API_KEY=$REDPILL_API_KEY - SMALL_REDPILL_MODEL=anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet - MEDIUM_REDPILL_MODEL=anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet - LARGE_REDPILL_MODEL=anthropic/claude-3-opus - ELEVENLABS_XI_API_KEY=$ELEVENLABS_XI_API_KEY - ELEVENLABS_MODEL_ID=eleven_multilingual_v2 - ELEVENLABS_VOICE_ID=21m00Tcm4TlvDq8ikWAM - ELEVENLABS_VOICE_STABILITY=0.5 - ELEVENLABS_VOICE_SIMILARITY_BOOST=0.9 - ELEVENLABS_VOICE_STYLE=0.66 - ELEVENLABS_VOICE_USE_SPEAKER_BOOST=false - ELEVENLABS_OPTIMIZE_STREAMING_LATENCY=4 - ELEVENLABS_OUTPUT_FORMAT=pcm_16000 - TWITTER_DRY_RUN=false - TWITTER_USERNAME=$TWITTER_USERNAME - TWITTER_PASSWORD=$TWITTER_PASSWORD - TWITTER_EMAIL=$TWITTER_EMAIL - X_SERVER_URL=$X_SERVER_URL - BIRDEYE_API_KEY=$BIRDEYE_API_KEY - SOL_ADDRESS=So11111111111111111111111111111111111111112 - SLIPPAGE=1 - SOLANA_RPC_URL=https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com - HELIUS_API_KEY=$HELIUS_API_KEY - SERVER_PORT=3000 - WALLET_SECRET_SALT=$WALLET_SECRET_SALT - TEE_MODE=PRODUCTION ports: - '3000:80' restart: always volumes: tee: Now you can deploy the Eliza agent to a real TEE environment. Go to the TEE Cloud and click on the Create VM button to configure your Eliza agent deployment. Click on the Compose Manifest Mode tab and paste the docker-compose.yaml file content into the Compose Manifest field. Next, go to the Resources tab and configure your VM resources. Note: The CPU and Memory resources should be greater than the minimum requirements for your agent configuration (Recommended: 2 CPU, 4GB Memory, 50GB Disk). Finally, click on the Submit button to deploy your Eliza agent. This will take a few minutes to complete. Once the deployment is complete, you can click on the View button to view your Eliza agent. Here is an example of a deployed agent named vitalik2077: I can go to the dashboard and view the remote attestation info: Click on the Logs tab to view the agent logs. Now we can verify the REAL TEE attestation quote by going to the TEE RA Explorer and pasting the attestation quote from the agent logs. Congratulations! You have successfully run an Eliza agent in a real TEE environment.","keywords":"","version":"0.25.9"},{"title":"üß† Eliza with FHE","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/docs/0.25.9/advanced/eliza-with-fhe","content":"üß† Eliza with FHE Overview‚Äã Eliza agents require FHE (Fully Homomorphic Encryption) to process encrypted data directly and continuously. FHE is often considered the &quot;holy grail&quot; of cryptography in DeCC (Decentralized Confidential Computing) and supports various demands from AI agents, such as achieving consensus through anonymous voting and enabling collaborative decision-making among agents. This guide provides step-by-step instructions for setting up and running an Eliza agent with FHE capabilities using the FHE Plugin, developed by Mind Network, within the Eliza Framework. Objective‚Äã FHE is a form of encryption that enables computations to be performed on encrypted data without requiring decryption first. The results of these computations remain encrypted, and when decrypted, they yield outputs identical to those from operations performed on unencrypted data. FHE has long been a &quot;dream&quot; for cryptographers, with a rich history that began in the 1970s. However, it only began to mature in the 2020s and is now gaining popularity among AI agents. The FHE Plugin in the Eliza Framework is built on top of the Mind Network FHE TypeScript SDK. This SDK is designed to simplify the process for developers to enable FHE capabilities in their agents while adhering to default security best practices. FHE unlocks many use cases. In this tutorial, we will use the anonymous voting use case to demonstrate how AI agents can be equipped with FHE. Key Features of the FHE Plugin‚Äã Voter Registration Use Case: Join Mind Network's Randgen Hub and other hubs to participate in secure voting, validation, and consensus.FHE Encryption: Protect vote content using Fully Homomorphic Encryption. Unlike traditional encryption, the encryption key is never shared, yet computations can still be performed on encrypted data.Submit Encrypted Votes: Cast votes in Mind Network Hubs elections without compromising data privacy. This allows AI agents to achieve consensus on collective predictions, inference, and serving.Reward Tracking: Monitor your rewards earned through voting contributions. In this tutorial, we‚Äôll explore how to leverage these features to enable secure, privacy-preserving AI agent interactions using FHE. Background‚Äã This section will provide mathematical definition and proof to who are interested in theory. You can skip it to next step by focusing on development tutorial only. FHE 101‚Äã The main idea of FHE is that operations performed on the encrypted data produce an encrypted result, which, when decrypted, matches the result of the same operations performed on the plaintext data. Core Components‚Äã Encryption: Transform plaintext data into ciphertext using an encryption key. c = E_k(m) Where: $m$: plaintext message$k$: encryption key$E_k$: encryption function$c$: ciphertext Computation on Encrypted Data: Perform operations directly on the ciphertext, such as addition or multiplication, to produce a new ciphertext. c' = F(c_1, c_2) Where: $c_1, c_2$: input ciphertexts$F$: homomorphic function (e.g., addition, multiplication)$c'$: resulting ciphertext after computation Decryption: Decrypt the result to reveal the final output, which matches the result of performing the operation on the plaintext. m' = D_k(c') Where: $D_k$: decryption function$m'$: result of computation in plaintext form Example: Addition Using FHE‚Äã Suppose we have two plaintext values, $m_1$ and $m_2$: Encrypt them: c_1 = E_k(m_1), c_2 = E_k(m_2) Perform homomorphic addition on the ciphertexts: c' = c_1 + c_2 Decrypt the result: m' = D_k(c') =&gt; m' = m_1 + m_2 Example: Multiplication Using FHE‚Äã For multiplication, the process is similar: Encrypt two plaintext values:$$c_1 = E_k(m_1), \\quad c_2 = E_k(m_2)$$Perform homomorphic multiplication:$$c' = c_1 \\cdot c_2$$Decrypt the result:$$m' = D_k(c') \\implies m' = m_1 \\cdot m_2$$ Anonymous Voting and Consensus with FHE use case‚Äã FHE is powerful because it ensures data privacy by never exposing the plaintext during computation, which is critical for secure and confidential processing of sensitive data. Anonymous voting with FHE ensures that individual votes remain private while enabling the computation of the final tally without decrypting individual votes. Below is a step-by-step explanation using mathematical notations. 1. Voter Setup‚Äã Each voter $i$ has a plaintext vote $v_i$ where: v_i \\in \\{0, 1\\} $0$: Vote for option A.$1$: Vote for option B. Each voter encrypts their vote using a public encryption key $k$: c_i = E_k(v_i) Where: $E_k$: FHE encryption function.$c_i$: Encrypted vote (ciphertext). 2. Collecting Encrypted Votes‚Äã All encrypted votes $c_i$ are submitted to a secure voting server. The server collects the ciphertexts: C = \\{c_1, c_2, \\dots, c_n\\} Where $n$ is the total number of voters. 3. Homomorphic Aggregation‚Äã The server computes the encrypted sum of all votes directly on the ciphertexts using FHE's additive homomorphism: c_{\\text{sum}} = \\sum_{i=1}^n c_i This operation produces a single ciphertext $c_{sum}$ representing the total votes in encrypted form, without revealing individual votes. 4. Decryption of the Result‚Äã Once the computation is complete, an authorized party with the private key $k$ decrypts the aggregated ciphertext to obtain the final tally: v_{\\text{sum}} = D_k(c_{\\text{sum}}) Where: $D_k$: Decryption function.$v_{sum}$: The total number of votes for option B. The final tally is: v_{\\text{sum}} = \\sum_{i=1}^n v_i Example Walkthrough‚Äã Voter Encryption: Voter 1: $v‚ÇÅ = 1, c‚ÇÅ = E_k(1)$Voter 2: $v‚ÇÇ = 0, c‚ÇÇ = E_k(0)$Voter 3: $v‚ÇÉ = 1, c‚ÇÉ = E_k(1)$ Homomorphic Aggregation: c_{\\text{sum}} = c_1 + c_2 + c_3 Decryption of the Result: v_{\\text{sum}} = D_k(c_{\\text{sum}}) \\implies v_{\\text{sum}} = 1 + 0 + 1 = 2 Security and Privacy‚Äã Privacy: Individual votes $v_i$ remain encrypted and are never exposed during aggregation.Anonymity: Votes are aggregated in ciphertext form, ensuring that no voter can be linked to their vote.Integrity: The final result $v_{sum}$ accurately reflects the sum of all votes, guaranteed by FHE. This mathematical workflow demonstrates how anonymous voting can be securely implemented using FHE. Tutorial‚Äã Dependency‚Äã Dependency for the plugin: mind-randgen-sdkmind-sdk-hubselizaos Installation‚Äã To install the plugin, use the following command: pnpm install @elizaos/plugin-mind-network Configuration‚Äã Before using the plugin, configure the necessary environment variables: MIND_HOT_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY=&lt;Hot wallet private key to vote&gt; MIND_COLD_WALLET_ADDRESS=&lt;Cold wallet address to receive rewards&gt; Run‚Äã Congratulations!

This proves that your agent‚Äôs thoughts and outputs are free from human control thus increasing the trust of the agent. Compared to fully deploying the agent in a TEE, this is a more light-weight solution which only verifies the inference calls and only needs a single line of code change. The API supports all OpenAI models out of the box, including your fine-tuned models. The following guide will walk you through how to use verified inference API with Eliza. Background‚Äã The API is built on top of Sentience Stack, which cryptographically verifies the agent's LLM inferences inside TEEs, posts those proofs on-chain on Solana, and makes the verified inference logs available to read and display to users. Here‚Äôs how it works: The agent sends a request containing a message with the desired LLM model to the TEE.The TEE securely processes the request by calling the LLM API.The TEE sends back the {Message, Proof} to the agent.The TEE submits the attestation with {Message, Proof} to Solana.The Proof of Sentience SDK is used to read the attestation from Solana and verify it with {Message, Proof}. The proof log can be added to the agent's website/app. To verify the code running inside the TEE, use instructions from here.

How do Actions work?‚Äã Actions consist of a name, description, validation function, and handler function that determine when and how an agent can perform a specific task. What can Actions do?‚Äã Actions enable agents to interact with external systems, modify behavior, process complex workflows, and extend capabilities beyond conversational responses. What are some example Actions?‚Äã Common actions include CONTINUE (extend dialogue), IGNORE (end conversation), GENERATE_IMAGE (create images), TRANSFER (move tokens), and READ_CONTRACT (retrieve blockchain data). How do I create a custom Action?‚Äã Define an action with a unique name, validation function to check eligibility, handler function to implement the logic, and provide usage examples. What makes a good Action?‚Äã A good action has a clear, single purpose, robust input validation, comprehensive error handling, and provides meaningful interactions. Can Actions be chained together?‚Äã Yes, actions can be composed and chained to create complex workflows and multi-step interactions. How are Actions different from tools?‚Äã Actions are more comprehensive, ensuring the entire process happens, while tools are typically more focused on specific, discrete operations. Where are Actions defined?‚Äã Actions can be defined in character files, plugins, or directly in agent configurations.

It handles message processing, state management, plugin integration, and interaction with external services. You can think of it as the brains that provide the high-level orchestration layer for Eliza agents. The runtime follows this general flow: Agent loads character config, plugins, and services Processes knowledge sources (e.g., documents, directories) Receives a message, composes the stateProcesses actions and then evaluates Retrieves relevant knowledge fragments using RAG Generates and executes responses, then evaluatesUpdates memory and state Overview‚Äã The AgentRuntime class is the primary implementation of the IAgentRuntime interface, which manages the agent's core functions, including: Component\tDescription\tAPI Reference\tRelated FilesClients\tSupports multiple communication platforms for seamless interaction.\tClients API\tclients.ts, Discord, Telegram, Twitter, Farcaster, Lens, Slack, Auto, GitHub State\tMaintains context for coherent cross-platform interactions, updates dynamically.

WIP Service System‚Äã Services provide specialized functionality with standardized interfaces that can be accessed cross-platform: See Example // Speech Generation const speechService = runtime.getService&lt;ISpeechService&gt;( ServiceType.SPEECH_GENERATION ); const audioStream = await speechService.generate(runtime, text); // PDF Processing const pdfService = runtime.getService&lt;IPdfService&gt;(ServiceType.PDF); const textContent = await pdfService.convertPdfToText(pdfBuffer); State Management‚Äã The runtime maintains comprehensive state through the State interface: interface State { // Core identifiers userId?: UUID; agentId?: UUID; roomId: UUID; // Character information bio: string; lore: string; messageDirections: string; postDirections: string; // Conversation context actors: string; actorsData?: Actor[]; recentMessages: string; recentMessagesData: Memory[]; // Goals and knowledge goals?: string; goalsData?: Goal[]; knowledge?: string; knowledgeData?: KnowledgeItem[]; ragKnowledgeData?: RAGKnowledgeItem[]; } // State management methods async function manageState() { // Initial state composition const state = await runtime.composeState(message, { additionalContext: 'custom context', }); // Update state with new messages const updatedState = await runtime.updateRecentMessageState(state); } Plugin System‚Äã Plugins extend agent functionality through a modular interface. The runtime supports various types of plugins including clients, services, adapters, and more: interface Plugin { name: string; description: string; actions?: Action[]; // Custom behaviors providers?: Provider[]; // Data providers evaluators?: Evaluator[]; // Response assessment services?: Service[]; // Background processes clients?: Client[]; // Platform integrations adapters?: Adapter[]; // Database/cache adapters } Plugins can be configured through characterfile settings: { &quot;name&quot;: &quot;MyAgent&quot;, &quot;plugins&quot;: [&quot;@elizaos/plugin-solana&quot;, &quot;@elizaos/plugin-twitter&quot;] } For detailed information about plugin development and usage, see the ElizaOS Registry. Running Multiple Agents‚Äã To run multiple agents: pnpm start --characters=&quot;characters/agent1.json,characters/agent2.json&quot; Or use environment variables: REMOTE_CHARACTER_URLS=https://example.com/characters.json FAQ‚Äã What's the difference between an agent and a character?‚Äã A character defines personality and knowledge, while an agent provides the runtime environment and capabilities to bring that character to life. How do I choose the right database adapter?‚Äã Choose based on your needs: MongoDB: For scalable, document-based storagePostgreSQL: For relational data with complex queriesSQLite: For simple, file-based storageQdrant: For vector search capabilities How do I implement custom plugins?‚Äã Create a plugin that follows the plugin interface and register it with the runtime. See the plugin documentation for detailed examples. Do agents share memory across platforms?‚Äã By default, agents maintain separate memory contexts for different platforms to avoid mixing conversations. Use the memory management system and database adapters to persist and retrieve state information. How do I handle multiple authentication methods?‚Äã Use the character configuration to specify different authentication methods for different services. The runtime will handle the appropriate authentication flow. How do I manage environment variables?‚Äã Use a combination of: .env files for local developmentCharacter-specific settings for per-agent configurationEnvironment variables for production deployment Can agents communicate with each other?‚Äã Yes, through the message system and shared memory spaces when configured appropriately.","keywords":"","version":"0.25.9"},{"title":"üìù Character Files","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/docs/0.25.9/core/characterfile","content":"üìù Character Files Character files are JSON-formatted configurations that define AI agent personas, combining personality traits, knowledge bases, and interaction patterns to create consistent and effective AI agents.

{ // Cleanup resources // Close connections }, }; } } Runtime Integration‚Äã Clients interact with the agent runtime through the IAgentRuntime interface, which provides: Memory managers for different types of data storageService access for capabilities like transcription or image generationState management and compositionMessage processing and action handling Memory System Integration‚Äã Clients use the runtime's memory managers to persist conversation data (source: memory.ts). messageManager Chat messagesdocumentsManager File attachmentsdescriptionManager Media descriptions See example // Store a new message await runtime.messageManager.createMemory({ id: messageId, content: { text: message.content }, userId: userId, roomId: roomId, agentId: runtime.agentId }); // Retrieve recent messages const recentMessages = await runtime.messageManager.getMemories({ roomId: roomId, count: 10 }); Direct Client Example‚Äã The Direct client provides message processing, webhook integration, and a REST API interface for Eliza agents.

Each client adapts these capabilities to its platform while maintaining consistent agent behavior. Can multiple clients be used simultaneously?‚Äã Yes, Eliza supports running multiple clients concurrently while maintaining consistent agent behavior across platforms. How are client-specific features handled?‚Äã Each client implements platform-specific features through its capabilities system, while maintaining a consistent interface for the agent. How co clients handle rate limits?‚Äã Clients implement platform-specific rate limiting with backoff strategies and queue management. How is client state managed?‚Äã Clients maintain their own connection state while integrating with the agent's runtime database adapter and memory / state management system. How do clients handle messages?‚Äã Clients translate platform messages into Eliza's internal format, process any attachments (images, audio, etc.), maintain conversation context, and manage response queuing and rate limits. How are messages processed across clients?‚Äã Each client processes messages independently in its platform-specific format, while maintaining conversation context through the shared memory system. V2 improves upon this architecture. How is state managed between clients?‚Äã Each client maintains separate state to prevent cross-contamination, but can access shared agent state through the runtime. How do clients integrate with platforms?‚Äã Each client implements platform-specific authentication, API compliance, webhook handling, and follows the platform's rules for rate limiting and content formatting. How do clients manage memory?‚Äã Clients use Eliza's memory system to track conversations, user relationships, and state, enabling context-aware responses and persistent interactions across sessions.","keywords":"","version":"0.25.9"},{"title":"üíæ Database Adapters","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/docs/0.25.9/core/database","content":"üíæ Database Adapters Database adapters provide persistent storage capabilities for ElizaOS agents.

Use MongoDB/PostgreSQL for production, SQLite for development, SQL.js/PGLite for browser environments, and Qdrant/Supabase for vector-focused applications. Can I switch adapters later?‚Äã Yes, all adapters implement the IDatabaseAdapter interface. Data migration between adapters is possible but requires additional steps. How are vector embeddings handled?‚Äã Each adapter implements vector storage based on its native capabilities - PostgreSQL/Supabase use native vector types, MongoDB uses array fields with indexes, SQLite uses BLOB storage, and Qdrant uses optimized vector stores. What about data migration?‚Äã Use the adapter's export/import methods defined in the DatabaseAdapter base class. How do I handle schema updates?‚Äã Run migrations using the adapter-specific CLI tools. Each adapter provides its own migration system - check the adapter's README in the elizaos-plugins repository. How do I fix database connection issues?‚Äã Check your connection string format, verify the database exists and is accessible, ensure proper adapter configuration, and consider using environment variables for credentials. How do I resolve embedding dimension mismatch errors?‚Äã Set USE_OPENAI_EMBEDDING=TRUE in your .env file. Different models use different vector dimensions (e.g., OpenAI uses 1536, some local models use 384). Clear your database when switching embedding models. How do I clear/reset my database?‚Äã Delete the db.sqlite file in your data directory and restart the agent. For production databases, use proper database management tools for cleanup. Which database should I use in production?‚Äã PostgreSQL with vector extensions is recommended for production deployments. SQLite works well for development but may not scale as effectively for production loads. How do I migrate between different database adapters?‚Äã Use the export/import methods provided by the DatabaseAdapter base class. Each adapter implements these methods for data migration, though you may need to handle schema differences manually.

Agents use evaluators to automatically process conversations after they happen to help build up their knowledge and understanding over time. They integrate with the AgentRuntime evaluation system to enable reflection, fact-gathering, and behavioral adaptation and run after each agent action to help maintain contextural awareness. Enabling agents to reflect on their actions and world state is crucial for improving coherence and problem-solving abilities. For example, by reflecting on its performance, an agent can refine its strategies and improve its interactions over time. How They Work‚Äã Evaluators run automatically after each agent action (responses, messages, activities, or API calls) to analyze what happened and update the agent's understanding. They extract important information (like facts about users), track progress on goals, and learn from interactions. Let's say you're at a party and meet someone new. During the conversation: You learn their name is SarahThey mention living in SeattleThey work as a software engineer After the conversation, your brain: Stores these facts for laterUpdates your understanding of who Sarah isMight note &quot;I should connect Sarah with Bob who's also in tech&quot; This is exactly how evaluators work for agents - they run in the background to extract insights, track progress, and build up the agent's knowledge over time. However there are some limitations, such as evaluators only process current interactions (can't modify past data), they run after actions complete (not during). Therefore evaluators are best for analysis rather than critical operations. The key thing to remember is: evaluators are your agent's way of learning and growing from each interaction, just like how we naturally process and learn from our conversations. Common Uses‚Äã Fact Evaluator: Learns and remembers facts about usersGoal Evaluator: Tracks progress on objectivesTrust Evaluator: Builds understanding of relationshipsSentiment Evaluator: Tracks emotional tone of conversations Implementation‚Äã Here's a basic example of an evaluator implementation: const evaluator = { // Should this evaluator run right now? validate: async (runtime, message) =&gt; { // Return true to run, false to skip return shouldRunThisTime; }, // What to do when it runs handler: async (runtime, message) =&gt; { // Extract info, update memory, etc const newInfo = extractFromMessage(message); await storeInMemory(newInfo); }, }; Core Interface‚Äã interface Evaluator { name: string; // Unique identifier similes: string[]; // Similar evaluator descriptions description: string; // Purpose and functionality validate: (runtime: IAgentRuntime, message: Memory) =&gt; Promise&lt;boolean&gt;; handler: (runtime: IAgentRuntime, message: Memory) =&gt; Promise&lt;any&gt;; examples: EvaluatorExample[]; } For full type definitions, see the Evaluator interface documentation. Validation Function‚Äã The validate function is critical for determining when an evaluator should run. For peak performance, proper validation ensures evaluators run only when necessary. For instance, a customer service agent might check if all required user data has been collected and only run if data is still missing. validate: async (runtime: IAgentRuntime, message: Memory) =&gt; boolean; Determines if evaluator should run for current message. Returns true to execute handler, false to skip. Should be efficient and quick to check. Handler Function‚Äã The handler function contains the evaluator's code. It is where the logic for analyzing data, extracting information, and triggering actions resides. handler: async (runtime: IAgentRuntime, message: Memory) =&gt; any; Contains main evaluation logic and runs when validate() returns true. Can access runtime services and memory. tip Ensure Evaluators are unique and lightweight Avoid complex operations or lengthy computations within the evaluator's handler function and ensure that evaluators have clear and distinct responsibilities not already handled by other components for peak performance. Memory Integration‚Äã Results are stored using runtime memory managers: // Example storing evaluation results const memory = await runtime.memoryManager.addEmbeddingToMemory({ userId: user?.id, content: { text: evaluationResult }, roomId: roomId, embedding: await embed(runtime, evaluationResult), }); await runtime.memoryManager.createMemory(memory); Fact Evaluator‚Äã :::info Deep Dive For a comprehensive guide on how the fact evaluator system works, including implementation details and best practices, check out our Fact Evaluator Guide. ::: The Fact Evaluator is one of the most powerful built-in evaluators. It processes convos to: Extract meaningful facts and opinions about users and the worldDistinguish between permanent facts, opinions, and statusTrack what information is already known vs new informationBuild up the agent's understanding over time through embeddings and memory storage Facts are stored with the following structure: interface Fact { claim: string; // The actual information extracted type: 'fact' | 'opinion' | 'status'; // Classification of the information in_bio: boolean; // Whether this info is already in the agent's knowledge already_known: boolean; // Whether this was previously extracted } Example Facts‚Äã Here's an example of extracted facts from a conversation: User: I finally finished my marathon training program! Agent: That's a huge accomplishment! How do you feel about it? User: I'm really proud of what I achieved. It was tough but worth it. Agent: What's next for you? User: I'm actually training for a triathlon now. It's a whole new challenge. const extractedFacts = [ { claim: 'User completed marathon training', type: 'fact', // Permanent info / achievement in_bio: false, already_known: false, // Prevents duplicate storage }, { claim: 'User feels proud of their achievement', type: 'opinion', // Subjective views or feelings in_bio: false, already_known: false, }, { claim: 'User is currently training for a triathlon', type: 'status', // Ongoing activity, changeable in_bio: false, already_known: false, }, ]; View Full Fact Evaluator Implementation import { composeContext } from '@elizaos/core'; import { generateObjectArray } from '@elizaos/core'; import { MemoryManager } from '@elizaos/core'; import { type ActionExample, type IAgentRuntime, type Memory, ModelClass, type Evaluator, } from '@elizaos/core'; export const formatFacts = (facts: Memory[]) =&gt; { const messageStrings = facts.reverse().map((fact: Memory) =&gt; fact.content.text); const finalMessageStrings = messageStrings.join('\\n'); return finalMessageStrings; }; const factsTemplate = // {{actors}} `TASK: Extract Claims from the conversation as an array of claims in JSON format. # START OF EXAMPLES These are examples of the expected output of this task: {{evaluationExamples}} # END OF EXAMPLES # INSTRUCTIONS Extract any claims from the conversation that are not already present in the list of known facts above: - Try not to include already-known facts.

Providers inform decisions, evaluators learn from outcomes. Can evaluators modify agent behavior?‚Äã Evaluators can influence future behavior by storing insights in memory, but cannot directly modify agent responses or interrupt ongoing actions. How many evaluators can run simultaneously?‚Äã There's no hard limit, but each evaluator adds processing overhead. Focus on essential evaluations and use efficient validation to optimize performance. Can evaluators communicate with each other?‚Äã Evaluators don't directly communicate but can share data through the memory system. One evaluator can read insights stored by another. How are evaluation results persisted?‚Äã Results are stored using the runtime's memory managers with embeddings for efficient retrieval. See the IMemoryManager interface for details. What's the difference between similes and examples in evaluators?‚Äã Similes provide alternative descriptions of the evaluator's purpose, while examples show concrete scenarios with inputs and expected outcomes. Examples help verify correct implementation. Can evaluators be conditionally enabled?‚Äã Yes, use the validation function to control when evaluators run. This can be based on message content, user status, or other runtime conditions.","keywords":"","version":"0.25.9"},{"title":"Fact Evaluator: Memory Formation System","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/docs/0.25.9/core/fact-evaluator","content":"Fact Evaluator: Memory Formation System The Fact Evaluator serves as the agent's &quot;episodic memory formation&quot; system - similar to how humans process conversations and form memories. Just as you might reflect after a conversation &quot;Oh, I learned something new about Sarah today&quot;, the Fact Evaluator systematically processes conversations to build up the agent's understanding of the world and the people in it. How It Works‚Äã 1. Triggering (The &quot;When to Reflect&quot; System)‚Äã validate: async (runtime: IAgentRuntime, message: Memory): Promise&lt;boolean&gt; =&gt; { const messageCount = await runtime.messageManager.countMemories(message.roomId); const reflectionCount = Math.ceil(runtime.getConversationLength() / 2); return messageCount % reflectionCount === 0; }; Just like humans don't consciously analyze every single word in real-time, the Fact Evaluator runs periodically rather than after every message. It triggers a &quot;reflection&quot; phase every few messages to process what's been learned. 2. Fact Extraction (The &quot;What Did I Learn?&quot; System)‚Äã The evaluator uses a template-based approach to extract three types of information: Facts: Unchanging truths about the world or people &quot;Bob lives in New York&quot;&quot;Sarah has a degree in Computer Science&quot; Status: Temporary or changeable states &quot;Bob is currently working on a new project&quot;&quot;Sarah is visiting Paris this week&quot; Opinions: Subjective views, feelings, or non-factual statements &quot;Bob thinks the project will be successful&quot;&quot;Sarah loves French cuisine&quot; 3. Memory Deduplication (The &quot;Is This New?&quot; System)‚Äã const filteredFacts = facts.filter((fact) =&gt; { return ( !fact.already_known &amp;&amp; fact.type === 'fact' &amp;&amp; !fact.in_bio &amp;&amp; fact.claim &amp;&amp; fact.claim.trim() !== '' ); }); Just as humans don't need to consciously re-learn things they already know, the Fact Evaluator: Checks if information is already knownVerifies if it's in the agent's existing knowledge (bio)Filters out duplicate or corrupted facts 4. Memory Storage (The &quot;Remember This&quot; System)‚Äã const factMemory = await factsManager.addEmbeddingToMemory({ userId: agentId!, agentId, content: { text: fact }, roomId, createdAt: Date.now(), }); Facts are stored with embeddings to enable: Semantic search of related factsContext-aware recallTemporal tracking (when the fact was learned) Example Processing‚Äã Given this conversation: User: &quot;I just moved to Seattle last month!&quot; Agent: &quot;How are you finding the weather there?&quot; User: &quot;It's rainy, but I love my new job at the tech startup&quot; The Fact Evaluator might extract: [ { &quot;claim&quot;: &quot;User moved to Seattle last month&quot;, &quot;type&quot;: &quot;fact&quot;, &quot;in_bio&quot;: false, &quot;already_known&quot;: false }, { &quot;claim&quot;: &quot;User works at a tech startup&quot;, &quot;type&quot;: &quot;fact&quot;, &quot;in_bio&quot;: false, &quot;already_known&quot;: false }, { &quot;claim&quot;: &quot;User enjoys their new job&quot;, &quot;type&quot;: &quot;opinion&quot;, &quot;in_bio&quot;: false, &quot;already_known&quot;: false } ] Key Design Considerations‚Äã Episodic vs Semantic Memory Facts build up the agent's semantic memory (general knowledge)The raw conversation remains in episodic memory (specific experiences) Temporal Awareness Facts are timestamped to track when they were learnedStatus facts can be updated as they change Confidence and Verification Multiple mentions of a fact increase confidenceContradictory facts can be flagged for verification Privacy and Relevance Only stores relevant, conversation-appropriate factsRespects explicit and implicit privacy boundaries Integration with Other Systems‚Äã The Fact Evaluator works alongside other evaluators and systems: Goal Evaluator: Facts may influence goal progressTrust Evaluator: Fact consistency affects trust scoringMemory Manager: Facts enhance context for future conversationsProviders: Facts inform response generation Common Patterns‚Äã Progressive Learning // First conversation &quot;I live in Seattle&quot; -&gt; Stores as fact // Later conversation &quot;I live in the Ballard neighborhood&quot; -&gt; Updates/enhances existing fact Fact Chaining // Original facts 'Works at tech startup'; 'Startup is in Seattle'; // Inference potential 'Works in Seattle tech industry'; Temporal Tracking // Status tracking t0: 'Looking for a job'(status); t1: 'Got a new job'(fact); t2: 'Been at job for 3 months'(status); Best Practices‚Äã Validate Facts Cross-reference with existing knowledgeConsider source reliabilityTrack fact confidence levels Manage Memory Growth Prioritize important factsConsolidate related factsArchive outdated status facts Handle Contradictions Flag conflicting factsMaintain fact historyUpdate based on newest information Respect Privacy Filter sensitive informationConsider contextual appropriatenessFollow data retention policies","keywords":"","version":"0.25.9"},{"title":"RAG Knowledge Documentation","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/docs/0.25.9/core/knowledge","content":"RAG Knowledge Documentation Overview‚Äã The RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Knowledge feature is a powerful system that enables agents to process, store, and retrieve information from various document types (PDF, Markdown, and text files).

Think of it as a conductor leading an orchestra - it ensures all parts work together harmoniously. It serves as the central coordination layer for message processing, memory management, state composition, action execution, and integration with AI models and external services. Core Functions: Coordinates message processingManages the agent's lifecycleHandles integration with AI modelsOrchestrates plugins and services Character Files‚Äã The Personality Character Files (src/types.ts) define agent personalities and capabilities including biographical information, interaction styles, plugin configurations, and platform integrations. The character file defines who your agent is - like a script for an actor. It includes: Biographical information and backstoryTopics the agent can discussWriting style and toneWhich AI models to useWhich plugins to loadWhich platforms to connect to Clients‚Äã The Interface Clients connect your agent to different platforms (Discord, Twitter, Slack, Farcaster, etc.) while maintaining consistent behavior across all interfaces. Each client can handle different types of interactions: Chat messagesSocial media postsVoice conversationsPlatform-specific features Actions‚Äã What Agents Can Do Actions (src/actions.ts) are like tools in a toolbox. They define how agents respond and interact with messages, enabling custom behaviors, external system interactions, media processing, and platform-specific features. Evaluators‚Äã Quality Control Evaluators (src/evaluators.ts) act like referees, making sure the agent follows rules and guidelines. They monitor conversations and help improve agent responses over time by assessing conversations and maintaining agent knowledge through fact extraction, goal tracking, memory building, and relationship management. Providers‚Äã Information Flow Providers (src/providers.ts) are the agent's eyes and ears, like a newsroom keeping them informed about the world. They supply real-time information to agents by integrating external APIs, managing temporal awareness, and providing system status updates to help agents make better decisions. Memory &amp; Knowledge Systems‚Äã The framework implements specialized memory systems through: Memory Manager‚Äã The Memory Manager (src/memory.ts) acts like a personal diary and helps agents remember: Recent conversationsImportant factsUser interactionsImmediate context for current discussions Knowledge Systems‚Äã Think of this as the agent's library (src/knowledge.ts, src/ragknowledge.ts), where information is: Organized into searchable chunksConverted into vector embeddingsRetrieved based on relevanceUsed to enhance responses Data Management‚Äã The data layer provides robust storage and caching through: Database System‚Äã The database (src/database.ts) acts as a filing cabinet, storing: Conversation historiesUser interactionsTransaction managementVector storageRelationship trackingEmbedded knowledgeAgent state See also: Memory Management Cache System‚Äã Performance Optimization The Cache System (src/cache.ts) creates shortcuts for frequently accessed information, making agents respond faster and more efficiently. System Flow‚Äã When someone interacts with your agent, the Client receives the message and forwards it to the Runtime which processes it with the characterfile configuration. The Runtime loads relevant memories and knowledge, uses actions and evaluators to determine how to response, gets additional context through providers. Then the Runtime generates a response using the AI model, stores new memories, and sends the response back through the client. Common Patterns‚Äã Memory Usage (src/memory.ts)‚Äã // Store conversation data await messageManager.createMemory({ id: messageId, content: { text: 'Message content' }, userId: userId, roomId: roomId, }); // Retrieve context const recentMessages = await messageManager.getMemories({ roomId: roomId, count: 10, }); Action Implementation (src/actions.ts)‚Äã const customAction: Action = { name: 'CUSTOM_ACTION', similes: ['ALTERNATE_NAME'], description: 'Action description', validate: async (runtime, message) =&gt; { // Validation logic return true; }, handler: async (runtime, message) =&gt; { // Implementation logic return true; }, }; Provider Integration (src/providers.ts)‚Äã const dataProvider: Provider = { get: async (runtime: IAgentRuntime, message: Memory) =&gt; { // Fetch and format data return 'Formatted context string'; }, }; FAQ‚Äã What's the difference between Actions, Evaluators, and Providers?‚Äã Actions define what an agent can do, Evaluators analyze what happened, and Providers supply information to help make decisions. Can I use multiple AI models with one agent?‚Äã Yes, agents can be configured to use different models for different tasks (chat, image generation, embeddings) through the modelProvider settings. How does memory persistence work?‚Äã Memory is stored through database adapters which can use SQLite, PostgreSQL, or other backends, with each type (messages, facts, knowledge) managed separately. What's the difference between Lore and Knowledge?‚Äã Lore defines the character's background and history, while Knowledge represents factual information the agent can reference and use. How do I add custom functionality?‚Äã Create plugins that implement the Action, Provider, or Evaluator interfaces and register them with the runtime. Do I need to implement all components?‚Äã No, each component is optional. Start with basic Actions and add Evaluators and Providers as needed. How does RAG integration work?‚Äã Documents are chunked, embedded, and stored in the knowledge base for semantic search during conversations via the RAGKnowledgeManager. What's the recommended database for production?‚Äã PostgreSQL with vector extensions is recommended for production, though SQLite works well for development and testing.","keywords":"","version":"0.25.9"},{"title":"Plugins","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/docs/0.25.9/core/plugins","content":"Plugins Plugins (or packages) are modular extensions that enhance the capabilities of ElizaOS agents. They provide a flexible way to add new functionality, integrate external services, and customize agent behavior across different platforms. Browse the various plugins the eliza dev community made here: Package Showcase elizaOS maintains an official package registry at github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry. Installation‚Äã Eliza now supports dynamic plugin loading directly from the package registry. Here's a couple ways you can add plugins on eliza: Add the plugin to your project's dependencies (package.json): { &quot;dependencies&quot;: { &quot;@elizaos/plugin-solana&quot;: &quot;github:elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana&quot;, &quot;@elizaos/plugin-twitter&quot;: &quot;github:elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter&quot; } } Configure the plugin in your character file: { &quot;name&quot;: &quot;MyAgent&quot;, &quot;plugins&quot;: [ &quot;@elizaos/plugin-twitter&quot;, &quot;@elizaos/plugin-example&quot; ], &quot;settings&quot;: { &quot;example-plugin&quot;: { // Plugin-specific configuration } } } Use the new CLI tool: You can list available plugins, install new ones, and remove them when needed.

This approach ensures consistent behavior and better extensibility. Here's how the architecture works: Plugin Types: Each plugin can provide one or more of the following: Clients (e.g., Discord, Twitter, WhatsApp integrations)Adapters (e.g., database adapters, caching systems)Actions (custom behavior and responses functionality)Evaluators (analysis, learning, decision-making components)Services (background processes and integrations)Providers (data or functionality providers) Plugin Interface: All plugins implement the core Plugin interface: type Plugin = { name: string; description: string; config?: { [key: string]: any }; actions?: Action[]; providers?: Provider[]; evaluators?: Evaluator[]; services?: Service[]; clients?: Client[]; adapters?: Adapter[]; }; Independent Repositories: Each plugin lives in its own repository under the elizaos-plugins organization, allowing: Independent versioning and releasesFocused issue tracking and documentationEasier maintenance and contributionSeparate CI/CD pipelines Plugin Structure: Each plugin repository should follow this structure: plugin-name/ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ images/ ‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ logo.jpg # Plugin branding logo ‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ banner.jpg # Plugin banner image ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/ ‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.ts # Main plugin entry point ‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ actions/ # Plugin-specific actions ‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ clients/ # Client implementations ‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ adapters/ # Adapter implementations ‚îÇ ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ types.ts # Type definitions ‚îÇ ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ environment.ts # runtime.getSetting, zod validation ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json # Plugin dependencies ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md # Plugin documentation Package Configuration: Your plugin's package.json must include an agentConfig section: { &quot;name&quot;: &quot;@elizaos/plugin-example&quot;, &quot;version&quot;: &quot;1.0.0&quot;, &quot;agentConfig&quot;: { &quot;pluginType&quot;: &quot;elizaos:plugin:1.0.0&quot;, &quot;pluginParameters&quot;: { &quot;API_KEY&quot;: { &quot;type&quot;: &quot;string&quot;, &quot;description&quot;: &quot;API key for the service&quot; } } } } Plugin Loading: Plugins are dynamically loaded at runtime through the handlePluginImporting function, which: Imports the plugin moduleReads the plugin configurationValidates plugin parametersRegisters the plugin's components (clients, adapters, actions, etc.) Client and Adapter Implementation: When implementing clients or adapters: // Client example const discordPlugin: Plugin = { name: 'discord', description: 'Discord client plugin', clients: [DiscordClientInterface], }; // Adapter example const postgresPlugin: Plugin = { name: 'postgres', description: 'PostgreSQL database adapter', adapters: [PostgresDatabaseAdapter], }; // Adapter example export const browserPlugin = { name: 'default', description: 'Pdf', services: [PdfService], actions: [], }; Environment Variables and Secrets‚Äã Plugins can access environment variables and secrets in two ways: Character Configuration: Through agent.json.secret or character settings: { &quot;name&quot;: &quot;MyAgent&quot;, &quot;settings&quot;: { &quot;secrets&quot;: { &quot;PLUGIN_API_KEY&quot;: &quot;your-api-key&quot;, &quot;PLUGIN_SECRET&quot;: &quot;your-secret&quot; } } } Runtime Access: Plugins can access their configuration through the runtime: class MyPlugin implements Plugin { async initialize(runtime: AgentRuntime) { const apiKey = runtime.getSetting('PLUGIN_API_KEY'); const secret = runtime.getSetting('PLUGIN_SECRET'); } } The getSetting method follows this precedence: Character settings secretsCharacter settingsGlobal settings Pull Request Requirements‚Äã When submitting a plugin to the elizaOS Registry, your PR must include: Working Demo Evidence: Screenshots or video demonstrations of the plugin working with ElizaOSTest results showing successful integrationExample agent configuration using your pluginDocumentation of any specific setup requirements Integration Testing: Proof of successful dynamic loading with ElizaOSTest cases covering main functionalityError handling demonstrationsPerformance metrics (if applicable) Configuration Examples: { &quot;name&quot;: &quot;MyAgent&quot;, &quot;plugins&quot;: [&quot;@elizaos/your-plugin&quot;], &quot;settings&quot;: { &quot;your-plugin&quot;: { // Your plugin's configuration } } } Quality Checklist: Plugin follows the standard structure All required branding assets are included Documentation is complete and clear GitHub topics are properly set Tests are passing Demo evidence is provided Visit the [Elizaos Plugin Development Guide](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-image for detailed information on creating new plugins. Plugin Branding and Images‚Äã To maintain a consistent and professional appearance across the ElizaOS ecosystem, we recommend including the following assets in your plugin repository: Required Images: logo.png (400x400px) - Your plugin's square logobanner.png (1280x640px) - A banner image for your pluginscreenshot.png - At least one screenshot demonstrating your plugin's functionality Image Location: plugin-name/ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ assets/ ‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ logo.png ‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ banner.png ‚îÇ ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ screenshots/ ‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ screenshot1.png ‚îÇ ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ screenshot2.png Image Guidelines: Use clear, high-resolution imagesKeep file sizes optimized (&lt; 500KB for logos, &lt; 1MB for banners)Image exampleInclude alt text for accessibility Using Your Custom Plugins‚Äã Plugins that are not in the official registry for ElizaOS can be used as well.

Plugins allow you to expand agent functionality and share reusable components with other developers. When should I create a plugin versus using existing ones?‚Äã Create a plugin when you need custom functionality not available in existing plugins, want to integrate with external services, or plan to share reusable agent capabilities with the community. What are the main types of plugin components?‚Äã Actions handle specific tasks, Providers supply data, Evaluators analyze responses, Services run background processes, Clients manage platform connections, and Adapters handle storage solutions. How do I test a plugin during development?‚Äã Use the mock client with pnpm mock-eliza --characters=./characters/test.character.json for rapid testing, then progress to platform-specific testing like web interface or Twitter integration. Why isn't my plugin being recognized?‚Äã Most commonly this occurs due to missing dependencies, incorrect registration in your character file, or build configuration issues. Ensure you've run pnpm build and properly imported the plugin. Can I monetize my plugin?‚Äã Yes, plugins can be monetized through the ElizaOS marketplace or by offering premium features/API access, making them an effective distribution mechanism for software products. How do I debug plugin issues?‚Äã Enable debug logging, use the mock client for isolated testing, and check the runtime logs for detailed error messages about plugin initialization and execution. What's the difference between Actions and Services?‚Äã Actions handle specific agent responses or behaviors, while Services provide ongoing background functionality or external API integrations that multiple actions might use. Additional Resources‚Äã ElizaOS RegistryExample Plugins","keywords":"","version":"0.25.9"},{"title":"üîå Providers","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/docs/0.25.9/core/providers","content":"üîå Providers Providers are the sources of information for the agent. They provide data or state while acting as the agent's &quot;senses&quot;, injecting real-time information into the agent's context. They serve as the eyes, ears, and other sensory inputs that allow the agent to perceive and interact with its environment, like a bridge between the agent and various external systems such as market data, wallet information, sentiment analysis, and temporal context. Anything that the agent knows is either coming from like the built-in context or from a provider. For more info, see the providers API page. Here's an example of how providers work within ElizaOS: A news provider could fetch and format news.A computer terminal provider in a game could feed the agent information when the player is near a terminal.A wallet provider can provide the agent with the current assets in a wallet.A time provider injects the current date and time into the context. Overview‚Äã A provider's primary purpose is to supply dynamic contextual information that integrates with the agent's runtime. They format information for conversation templates and maintain consistent data access. For example: Function: Providers run during or before an action is executed.Purpose: They allow for fetching information from other APIs or services to provide different context or ways for an action to be performed.Example: Before a &quot;Mars rover action&quot; is executed, a provider could fetch information from another API. This fetched information can then be used to enrich the context of the Mars rover action. The provider interface is defined in types.ts: interface Provider { get: ( runtime: IAgentRuntime, // Which agent is calling the provider message: Memory, // Last message received state?: State // Current conversation state ) =&gt; Promise&lt;string&gt;; // Returns info to inject into context } The get function takes: runtime: The agent instance calling the providermessage: The last message receivedstate: Current conversation state (optional) It returns a string that gets injected into the agent's context. The function can return null if there is no reason to validate. Examples‚Äã ElizaOS providers typically fall into these categories, with examples from the ecosystem: System &amp; Integration‚Äã Time Provider: Injects current date/time for temporal awarenessGiphy Provider: Provides GIF responses using Giphy APIGitBook Provider: Supplies documentation context from GitBookTopics Provider: Caches and serves Allora Network topic information Blockchain &amp; DeFi‚Äã Wallet Provider: Portfolio data from Zerion, balances and pricesDePIN Provider: Network metrics via DePINScan APIChain Providers: Data from Abstract, Fuel, ICP, EVM networksMarket Provider: Token data from DexScreener, Birdeye APIs Knowledge &amp; Data‚Äã DKG Provider: OriginTrail decentralized knowledge integrationNews Provider: Current events via NewsAPITrust Provider: Calculates and injects trust scores Visit the ElizaOS Plugin Registry for a complete list of available plugins and providers. Time Provider‚Äã Source: packages/plugin-bootstrap/src/providers/time.ts Provides temporal awareness by injecting current date/time information: const timeProvider: Provider = { get: async (_runtime: IAgentRuntime, _message: Memory) =&gt; { const currentDate = new Date(); const options = { timeZone: 'UTC', dateStyle: 'full' as const, timeStyle: 'long' as const, }; const humanReadable = new Intl.DateTimeFormat('en-US', options).format(currentDate); return `The current date and time is ${humanReadable}. Please use this as your reference for any time-based operations or responses.`; }, }; Facts Provider‚Äã Source: packages/plugin-bootstrap/src/providers/facts.ts Manages and serves conversation facts and knowledge: const factsProvider: Provider = { get: async (runtime: IAgentRuntime, message: Memory, state?: State) =&gt; { // Get recent messages const recentMessagesData = state?.recentMessagesData?.slice(-10); const recentMessages = formatMessages({ messages: recentMessagesData, actors: state?.actorsData, }); // Generate embedding for semantic search const embedding = await embed(runtime, recentMessages); const memoryManager = new MemoryManager({ runtime, tableName: 'facts', }); // Retrieve relevant facts const facts = await memoryManager.getMemories({ roomId: message.roomId, count: 10, agentId: runtime.agentId, }); if (facts.length === 0) return ''; const formattedFacts = formatFacts(facts); return `Key facts that ${runtime.character.name} knows:\\n${formattedFacts}`; }, }; Boredom Provider‚Äã Source: packages/plugin-bootstrap/src/providers/boredom.ts Manages conversation dynamics and engagement by calculating a &quot;boredom score&quot;. The provider helps agents maintain appropriate conversation engagement levels by analyzing recent messages (last 15 minutes) and tracking conversational dynamics through keywords and pattern detection that then generates status messages reflecting interaction quality. Scoring Mechanisms‚Äã Increases Boredom: Excessive punctuationNegative or dismissive languageRepetitive conversation patterns Decreases Boredom: Substantive discussion topicsEngaging questionsResearch-related keywords // Sample scoring logic if (interestWords.some((word) =&gt; messageText.includes(word))) { boredomScore -= 1; } FAQ‚Äã What's a good caching strategy for providers?‚Äã Cache expensive operations with an appropriate TTL based on data freshness requirements - for example, the Topics Provider uses 30-minute caching. How should providers handle missing data?‚Äã Return an empty string for missing or invalid data rather than null or undefined. What's the best way to format provider output?‚Äã Keep context strings concise and consistently formatted, using clear templates when possible. When should I use a provider vs a service?‚Äã Use a provider when you need to inject information into the agent's context, and a service when the functionality doesn't need to be part of the conversation. Can providers access service functionality?‚Äã Yes, providers can use services through the runtime. For example, a wallet provider might use a blockchain service to fetch data. How should providers handle failures?‚Äã Providers should handle failures gracefully and return an empty string or implement retries for external API calls. Never throw errors that would break the agent's context composition. Can providers maintain state?‚Äã While providers can maintain internal state, it's better to use the runtime's state management facilities for persistence.

Think of it like taking a general-purpose chef and training them to become an expert in your favorite cuisine - they keep their fundamental cooking skills but learn your specific recipes and preferences. With fine-tuning, you can create models that: Write in your personal styleSpecialize in your industry's terminologyMatch your brand's voiceUnderstand your company's internal knowledge Getting Started‚Äã Guide for generating custom AI character files and training datasets using public data from Twitter and blogs. Just like choosing the right chef to train, picking the right base model is crucial. Together AI offers several options: For Beginners: Llama 3 8B Instruct - Great for simpler tasks and smaller datasetsGood for: Personal projects, testing fine-tuning, simpler use cases For Advanced Use Cases: Llama 3 70B Instruct - Best for complex tasks and larger datasetsGood for: Production applications, complex domain knowledge, nuanced interactions There are two ways to prepare your data: JSONL Format (Recommended for Beginners) {&quot;text&quot;: &quot;Your training example here&quot;} {&quot;text&quot;: &quot;Another training example&quot;} Simpler to create and understandWorks well for most use casesHandled automatically by the system Parquet Format (Advanced) Pre-tokenized dataMore control over trainingFaster processing for multiple runsRecommended when you need custom loss masking For this guide we're going to use JSONL format. Setup‚Äã We're going to use a tool to create a training dataset from sources like Twitter / Blogs: https://github.com/elizaOS/twitter-scraper-finetune. Alternatively you can also request a backup archive of your data from X and use this script: https://github.com/elizaOS/characterfile/blob/main/scripts/tweets2character.js, but then you'll miss the fine-tune parts of this guide.

What should I do after generating a character file?‚Äã Review and manually adjust the generated files, add specific behavioral examples, and fine-tune the system prompts for optimal outcomes. What are best practices for fine-tuning?‚Äã Start with test runs to validate your data, then closely monitor training metrics and thoroughly evaluate outputs before deployment. How can I make my agent's responses more natural/less bot-like?‚Äã Fine-tune the character's bio, lore, and post examples in the character file. Consider using different model providers and adjusting interaction settings. Some models (like DeepSeek) are noted for more natural responses. Why am I getting Twitter authentication failures?‚Äã Double-check your credentials in .env file, ensure your email is verified, and try adding rate limiting breaks between authentication attempts. Why isn't my data collection working?‚Äã Verify your network connectivity is stable, confirm the target account is public, and try increasing the retry parameters in your configuration. What should I do if I get fine-tuning errors?‚Äã First validate your JSONL file format is correct, then check your API key has proper permissions, and monitor any rate limits that may be affecting the process.","keywords":"","version":"0.25.9"},{"title":"Memory Management","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/docs/0.25.9/guides/memory-management","content":"Memory Management Overview‚Äã ElizaOS implements a sophisticated memory management system powered by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). This system enables agents to maintain contextual awareness and knowledge persistence across interactions while optimizing for both performance and accuracy. The Eliza framework uses multiple types of memory to support an agent's long-term engagement, contextual understanding, and adaptive responses. Each type of memory serves a specific purpose: Message History: Stores recent conversations to provide continuity within a session. This helps the agent maintain conversational context and avoid repetitive responses within short-term exchanges. Factual Memory: Holds specific, context-based facts about the user or environment, such as user preferences, recent activities, or specific details mentioned in previous interactions. This type of memory enables the agent to recall user-specific information across sessions. Knowledge Base: Contains general knowledge the agent might need to respond to broader queries or provide informative answers. This memory is more static, helping the agent retrieve pre-defined data, common responses, or static character lore. Relationship Tracking: Manages the agent‚Äôs understanding of its relationship with users, including details like user-agent interaction frequency, sentiment, and connection history. It is particularly useful for building rapport and providing a more personalized interaction experience over time. RAG Integration: Uses a vector search to perform contextual recall based on similarity matching. This enables the agent to retrieve relevant memory snippets or knowledge based on the content and intent of the current conversation, making its responses more contextually relevant. Memory Types‚Äã Memory Managers: messageManager: Manages conversation history.descriptionManager: Stores user descriptions.loreManager: Handles character lore and background.documentsManager: Manages large documents.knowledgeManager: Stores searchable document fragments.ragKnowledgeManager: Handles RAG-based knowledge retrieval. Short-term Memory (Message Context) Stores recent conversation historyAutomatically managed with configurable retentionUsed for maintaining immediate contextImplemented via the messageManager Long-term Memory (Descriptions) Persists learned information about users and contextsStores important facts and relationshipsManaged through the descriptionManagerSupports semantic search via vector embeddings Static Knowledge (Lore) Contains character-specific informationHolds historical data and background contextManaged via the loreManagerUsed for maintaining character consistency Document Storage Handles large document managementSupports multiple file formatsManaged through the documentsManagerEnables reference material integration RAG Knowledge Base Searchable document fragmentsOptimized for semantic retrievalManaged by ragKnowledgeManagerSupports dynamic knowledge integration Memory Systems‚Äã The Eliza framework uses multiple specialized memory managers to support different aspects of agent functionality: // Example memory manager usage const memoryManager = runtime.getMemoryManager('messages'); await memoryManager.createMemory({ id: messageId, content: { text: 'Message content' }, userId: userId, roomId: roomId, }); Memory managers support operations like: messageManager: Manages conversation history. descriptionManager: Stores user descriptions. loreManager: Handles character lore and background. documentsManager: Manages large documents. knowledgeManager: Stores searchable document fragments. ragKnowledgeManager: Handles RAG-based knowledge retrieval.

How do I reset my agent's memory?‚Äã Delete db.sqlite in the agent/data directory and restart the agent. For a complete reset, run pnpm clean followed by pnpm install. What storage options exist for agent memory?‚Äã SQLite for simple deployments, PostgreSQL/Supabase for complex needs. MongoDB also supported. Where should I store static knowledge vs dynamic memory?‚Äã Static knowledge goes in character.json's knowledge section. Dynamic memory uses database storage through memory system. How do I enable RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)?‚Äã Set &quot;ragKnowledge&quot;: true in character file. Use folder2knowledge to convert documents into knowledge, then knowledge2character to create character files. Do I need different memory setup for production?‚Äã Yes - PostgreSQL is recommended over SQLite for production deployments. How do I configure database adapters for memory?‚Äã Set up database URL in .env file and run proper migration scripts with required schema/functions. How do I handle large knowledge datasets?‚Äã Use proper database storage rather than storing directly in character file. Consider implementing custom vector database for larger datasets. How can I manage memory for multiple agents running simultaneously?‚Äã Each agent maintains its own memory system. Plan for ~2GB RAM per agent. How do I clear memory when changing models?‚Äã When switching between embedding models, delete the database and cached data before restarting the agent. How do I customize the memory system?‚Äã Use different database adapters (PostgreSQL, Supabase, MongoDB) and configure vector stores for knowledge management. How do I troubleshoot memory-related issues?‚Äã Check runtime logs, verify database connections, and consider clearing cache and database if behavior seems cached.

Core Concepts‚Äã Environment Variable Hierarchy‚Äã Eliza uses a hierarchical environment variable system that retrieves settings in this order: Character-specific secrets (highest priority)Character-specific settingsGlobal environment variablesDefault values (lowest priority) This allows you to override global settings for specific characters when needed. Common Secret Types‚Äã # API Keys for Model Providers OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-* # OpenAI API key ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-key # Anthropic/Claude API key GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY= # Gemini API key GROQ_API_KEY=gsk-* # Groq API key # Client Authentication DISCORD_API_TOKEN= # Discord bot token TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN= # Telegram bot token TWITTER_USERNAME= # Twitter/X username TWITTER_PASSWORD= # Twitter/X password # Database Credentials SUPABASE_URL= # Supabase URL SUPABASE_ANON_KEY= # Supabase anonymous key MONGODB_CONNECTION_STRING= # MongoDB connection string # Blockchain Related EVM_PRIVATE_KEY= # EVM private key with &quot;0x&quot; prefix SOLANA_PRIVATE_KEY= # Solana wallet private key SOLANA_PUBLIC_KEY= # Solana wallet public key For a complete list of supported environment variables, see the .env.example file in the project repository. Implementation‚Äã Setting Up Environment Variables‚Äã Create a .env file in your project root directory: cp .env.example .env Add your secrets to this file: # Model Provider OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxx # Clients DISCORD_API_TOKEN=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx The .env file is automatically excluded from Git via .gitignore to prevent accidental exposure. Accessing Secrets in Code‚Äã Use the runtime.getSetting() method to access configuration values: // In a plugin, action, or service const apiKey = runtime.getSetting('OPENAI_API_KEY'); if (!apiKey) { throw new Error('OpenAI API key not configured'); } // With a fallback value const temperature = runtime.getSetting('TEMPERATURE') || '0.7'; This method automatically handles the environment variable hierarchy, checking character-specific secrets first, then character settings, and finally global environment variables. Character-Specific Secrets‚Äã Define secrets for individual characters in their character file: { &quot;name&quot;: &quot;FinancialAssistant&quot;, &quot;settings&quot;: { &quot;secrets&quot;: { &quot;OPENAI_API_KEY&quot;: &quot;sk-character-specific-key&quot;, &quot;ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY&quot;: &quot;financial-data-api-key&quot; } } } Alternatively, use namespaced environment variables with this format: CHARACTER.&lt;CHARACTER_NAME&gt;.&lt;SECRET_NAME&gt;=value For example: CHARACTER.TraderAgent.OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-character-specific-key Best Practices‚Äã 1. Environment Segregation‚Äã Keep separate environment files for different deployment contexts: .env.development # Local development settings .env.staging # Testing environment .env.production # Production settings Load the appropriate file based on your NODE_ENV or custom environment flag. 2. Secret Validation‚Äã Validate required secrets before using them: function validateRequiredSecrets(runtime) { const required = ['OPENAI_API_KEY', 'DATABASE_URL']; const missing = required.filter((key) =&gt; !runtime.getSetting(key)); if (missing.length &gt; 0) { throw new Error(`Missing required secrets: ${missing.join(', ')}`); } } 3. Secure Error Handling‚Äã Avoid exposing secrets in error messages or logs: try { const apiKey = runtime.getSetting('API_KEY'); // Use API key... } catch (error) { // Log without exposing the secret console.error('Error using API:', error.message); // Don't log the actual API key! } 4. API Key Validation‚Äã Validate API key formats before use: // OpenAI API key validation const apiKey = runtime.getSetting('OPENAI_API_KEY'); if (apiKey &amp;&amp; !apiKey.startsWith('sk-')) { throw new Error('Invalid OpenAI API key format'); } // Mask before logging const maskedKey = apiKey ? `${apiKey.substring(0, 5)}...` : 'not set'; console.log('Using API key:', maskedKey); Security Considerations‚Äã Private Key Handling‚Äã Take extra care with blockchain private keys: // Retrieve private key from settings const privateKey = runtime.getSetting('WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY'); // Validate private key format (example for EVM) if (privateKey &amp;&amp; !privateKey.match(/^(0x)?[0-9a-fA-F]{64}$/)) { throw new Error('Invalid private key format'); } // Use private key securely - NEVER log the actual key console.log('Using wallet with address:', getAddressFromPrivateKey(privateKey)); Secret Rotation‚Äã Implement periodic key rotation for production deployments: Generate new API keys/credentialsUpdate environment variables or character secretsVerify functionality with new credentialsRevoke old credentials Cloud Deployment Security‚Äã When deploying to cloud environments: Use the platform's secrets management service: AWS: Secrets Manager or Parameter StoreGoogle Cloud: Secret ManagerAzure: Key VaultVercel/Netlify: Environment Variables UI Minimize secret access: Restrict which services can access which secretsUse short-lived credentials when possibleConfigure proper IAM roles and permissions Troubleshooting‚Äã Common Issues‚Äã 1.

Built with TypeScript, it provides a flexible and extensible platform for developing intelligent agents that can interact across multiple platforms while maintaining consistent personalities and knowledge. Technical Report (Whitepaper)Examples (Awesome Eliza) Key Features‚Äã Platform Integration: Clients for Discord, X (Twitter), Telegram, and many othersFlexible Model Support: Deepseek, Ollama, Grok, OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, LLama, etc.Character System: Create diverse agents using characterfilesMulti-Agent Architecture: Manage multiple unique AI personalities simultaneouslyMemory Management: Easily ingest and interact with documents using RAGMedia Processing: PDF, URLs, Audio transcription, Video processing, Image analysis, Conversation summarizationTechnical Foundation: 100% TypeScript implementationModular architectureHighly extensible action and plugin systemCustom client supportComprehensive API Use Cases‚Äã Eliza can be used to create: AI Assistants: Customer support agents, Community moderators, Personal assistantsSocial Media Personas: Automated content creators, Brand representatives, InfluencersKnowledge Workers: Research assistants, Content analysts, Document processorsInteractive Characters: Role-playing characters, Educational tutors, Entertainment bots Architecture‚Äã Source: https://x.com/0xCygaar/status/1874575841763770492 The characterfile contains everything about the agent's personality, backstory, knowledge, and topics to talk about, as well as which clients / models / and plugins to load. The database is where an agent stores relevant info for generating responses, including previous tweets, interactions, and embeddings. Without a db, agent's wouldn't be able to give good responses. Then we have the &quot;runtime&quot;, which you can think of as the core agent logic. It's effectively the coordination layer of the agent or the brain, calling the necessary modules and external services to generate responses and take actions. Within the runtime is the LLM, which processes various inputs and generates responses or action items for the agent to take. Devs can declare which LLM provider to use in the characterfile. The runtime also handles the registration of plugins, which are called when a user input asks it take an action, such as transferring ETH on Abstract or doing a web search. Eliza supports a variety of clients including Discord, Twitter, Slack, Farcaster, and others. The client is basically where the agent will live and interact with users. Agents can run on multiple clients at once. Clients can have modules to handle different interactions, such as responding to tweets, or even participating in Twitter spaces. Getting Started‚Äã For a more detailed guide, check out our Quickstart Guide to begin your journey with Eliza. Prerequisites‚Äã Python 2.7+Node.js 23+pnpm Note for Windows Users: WSL 2 is required.

Compile the typescript: pnpm build Start the Agent‚Äã Character files are where you can configure your agent's personality, lore, and capabilities via plugins. Inform eliza which character you want to run: pnpm start --character=&quot;characters/deep-thought.character.json&quot; You can load multiple characters with a comma-separated list: pnpm start --characters=&quot;characters/deep-thought.character.json,characters/sbf.character.json&quot; By default the agent will be accessible via the terminal and REST API. Chat Client‚Äã If you're using the main eliza repo and want to use the chat client, open a new terminal window and run the client's http server: pnpm start:client Once the client is running, you'll see a message like this: ‚ûú Local: http://localhost:5173/ Simply click the link or open your browser to http://localhost:5173/. You'll see the chat interface connect to the system, and you can begin interacting with your character. Additional Configuration‚Äã You can load plugins or additional client support with your character file to unlock more capabilities for your agent. Add Plugins and Clients‚Äã Here's how to import and register plugins in your character file: { &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Eliza&quot;, &quot;clients&quot;: [&quot;telegram&quot;], // ... other config options &quot;plugins&quot;: [&quot;@elizaos/plugin-image&quot;], } There are two ways to get a list of available plugins: Web Interface Go https://elizaos.github.io/registry/ or the Showcase and search for plugins CLI Interface $ npx elizaos plugins list Here's a sample list of plugins you can check out! plugin name\tDescription@elizaos/plugin-llama\tRun LLM models on your local machine @elizaos/client-twitter\tTwitter bot integration @elizaos/client-discord\tDiscord bot integration @elizaos/client-telegram\tTelegram integration @elizaos/plugin-image\tImage processing and analysis @elizaos/plugin-video\tVideo processing capabilities @elizaos/plugin-browser\tWeb scraping capabilities @elizaos/plugin-pdf\tPDF processing Configure Environment‚Äã There are two ways to configure elizaOS Option 1: Default .env file‚Äã Copying the .example.env file and editing is the simpler option especially if you plan to just host one agent: cp .env.example .env nano .env Option 2: Secrets in the character file‚Äã This option allows you finer grain control over which character uses what resources and is required if you want multiple agents but using different keys. For example: { &quot;name&quot;: &quot;eliza&quot;, // ... other config options &quot;settings&quot;: { &quot;secrets&quot;: { &quot;DISCORD_APPLICATION_ID&quot;: &quot;1234&quot;, &quot;DISCORD_API_TOKEN&quot;: &quot;xxxx&quot;, &quot;OPENAI_API_KEY&quot;: &quot;sk-proj-xxxxxxxxx-...&quot; } } Watch the commas to make sure it's valid json! Here's a few more config tips: Discord Bot Setup Create a new application at Discord Developer PortalCreate a bot and get your tokenAdd bot to your server using OAuth2 URL generatorSet DISCORD_API_TOKEN and DISCORD_APPLICATION_ID in your .env Twitter Integration Add to your .env: TWITTER_USERNAME= # Account username TWITTER_PASSWORD= # Account password TWITTER_EMAIL= # Account email TWITTER_2FA_SECRET= # In order to avoid X preventing the login, it is better to activate 2fa in the target account, copy the 2fa secret and paste it here Important: Log in to the Twitter Developer Portal and enable the &quot;Automated&quot; label for your account to avoid being flagged as inauthentic. Telegram Bot Create a botAdd your bot token to .env: TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=your_token_here GPU Acceleration‚Äã If you have a Nvidia GPU you can enable CUDA support. First ensure CUDA Toolkit, cuDNN, and cuBLAS are first installed, then: npx --no node-llama-cpp source download --gpu cuda FAQ‚Äã What's the difference between eliza and eliza-starter?‚Äã Eliza-starter is a lightweight version for simpler setups, while the main eliza repository includes all advanced features and a web client. How do I fix build/installation issues?‚Äã Use Node v23.3.0, run pnpm clean, then pnpm install --no-frozen-lockfile, followed by pnpm build. If issues persist, checkout the latest stable tag. What are the minimum system requirements?‚Äã 8GB RAM recommended for build process. For deployment, a t2.large instance on AWS with 20GB storage running Ubuntu is the minimum tested configuration.

The session covers the history and evolution of JavaScript, TypeScript, and the Node.js ecosystem, providing a solid foundation for understanding the tools and technologies used in building AI agents with Eliza. Origins and Ecosystem‚Äã JavaScript and Its Evolution‚Äã JavaScript was initially created as a simple scripting language for web browsers in 1995 by Brendan Eich.It has since evolved into a versatile language capable of running on servers with the introduction of Node.js, which leverages the V8 JavaScript engine. TypeScript for Type Safety‚Äã TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that introduces optional static typing, providing compile-time type checking and improved developer experience.It addresses JavaScript's lack of type safety while maintaining flexibility and compatibility with existing JavaScript code. The Power of npm (Node Package Manager)‚Äã npm is a vast ecosystem of pre-built JavaScript packages that facilitate rapid development and code reuse.With millions of packages available, developers can easily incorporate external libraries into their projects using the npm install command.The open-source nature of the npm ecosystem allows developers to leverage the collective efforts of the community and build upon existing code. Monorepos in Eliza Development‚Äã Eliza utilizes a monorepo structure, where multiple packages or projects are contained within a single repository.Monorepos offer advantages such as simplified management, easier collaboration, and the ability to share code between packages. Git and GitHub for Collaboration‚Äã Git is a distributed version control system that enables collaborative software development by tracking changes in code.GitHub is a web-based hosting service built on top of Git, providing features like issue tracking, pull requests, and wikis for effective collaboration and project management. Characters, Embeddings, and Discord Integration‚Äã Embedding Models‚Äã Embedding models play a crucial role in converting words or concepts into numerical vectors, capturing semantic meaning and enabling tasks like semantic search and comparison.These models transform textual data into multi-dimensional vectors, allowing for efficient representation and analysis of language. Creating Custom Characters in Eliza‚Äã Eliza allows developers to create custom AI characters with distinct personalities and behaviors.Character definitions are specified using JSON files, which include details like the character's bio, example dialogue, and configuration options.The flexibility of character customization enables tailoring agents for specific platforms and use cases. Integrating Discord Clients‚Äã Eliza provides seamless integration with Discord, allowing AI characters to interact with users on the popular communication platform.Setting up a Discord client involves configuring API keys, managing server permissions, and defining the character's behavior within the Discord environment. Key Concepts in Eliza‚Äã System Directives: Special instructions that guide the agent's overall behavior and decision-making process.Message Examples: Sample dialogues that demonstrate the desired communication style and tone of the AI character.Style Directions: Additional instructions that influence the agent's personality, vocabulary, and interaction style. Database, Clients, and Templates‚Äã Eliza's Database and Memory Management‚Äã Eliza utilizes a database system to store and manage data related to the AI agents, their interactions, and user information.The default database file is located within the Eliza project structure, but alternative database systems can be configured based on specific requirements. Clients in Eliza‚Äã Clients in Eliza refer to the various platforms and communication channels through which AI agents can interact with users.Existing clients include Discord, Twitter, and Telegram, each with its own set of features and integration requirements.Developers can create custom clients to extend Eliza's capabilities and support additional platforms or services. Eliza's Template System‚Äã Eliza employs a template system to structure and generate agent responses dynamically.Templates allow for the incorporation of variables, conditional logic, and other dynamic elements to create more engaging and context-aware interactions.The template system enables developers to define reusable patterns and customize agent responses based on various factors like user input, context, and character traits. By understanding these foundational concepts and components of the Eliza framework, developers can begin their journey into building sophisticated and interactive AI agents.

We explore each of these in detail, walking through code examples and common use cases. We also cover how to package up actions, providers and evaluators into reusable plugins.

In Eliza, an action is defined by: Name: The unique name used to reference the actionDescription: Used to inform the agent when this action should be invokedHandler: The code that actually executes the action logicValidator: Determines if the action is valid to be called given the current context Some key points about actions in Eliza: The agent decides which action to call based on the name and description. It does not have insight into the actual action code.The handler receives the agent runtime, the triggering message, the current state, and a callback function to send messages back to the user.The validate function allows for complex logic to determine action availability based on context and state. Providers: Injecting State and Context Providers allow developers to dynamically inject relevant information into the agent's context. This could be real-time data, user information, results of previous conversations, or any other state the agent may need. Key aspects of providers: Defined by a single get function that returns relevant stateCalled before each agent execution to hydrate the contextCan conditionally provide state based on the current context Common provider examples include current time, user preferences, conversation history, and external API data. Evaluators: Reflection and Analysis Evaluators run after each agent action, allowing the agent to reflect on what happened and potentially trigger additional actions. They are a key component in creating agents that can learn and adapt. Some common use cases for evaluators: Extracting and storing facts from a conversation for future referenceAnalyzing user sentiment to measure trust and relationshipIdentifying key intents and entities to inform future actionsImplementing feedback loops for agent improvement Evaluators work in close conjunction with providers - often an evaluator will extract some insight that a provider will then inject into future context. Packaging Plugins The plugin system in Eliza allows developers to package up related actions, providers and evaluators into reusable modules. A plugin is defined by: package.json: Metadata about the plugintsconfig.json: TypeScript configurationindex.ts: Registers the plugin's actions, providers and evaluatorssrc directory: Contains the actual action, provider and evaluator code Plugins can be published to npm and then easily imported into any Eliza agent. This enables a powerful ecosystem of reusable agent capabilities. Examples The session walks through several code examples to illustrate these concepts: Defining a simple &quot;Hello World&quot; actionCreating a &quot;Current News&quot; action that retrieves news headlinesImplementing a provider that injects a random emotion into the contextRegistering actions and providers in a plugin Key Takeaways Actions, providers and evaluators are the core building blocks of agent behavior in ElizaActions define what agents can do, providers manage context and state, and evaluators allow for reflection and adaptationThe plugin system enables reusable packaging of agent capabilitiesEffective prompt engineering around the composition of the agent context is a key area for optimization With a solid understanding of these abstractions, developers have immense power and flexibility to create agent behaviors in Eliza. The next session will dive into an end-to-end example.","keywords":"","version":"0.25.9"},{"title":"Part 3: Building a User Data Extraction Agent","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/docs/0.25.9/tutorials/devschool/part3","content":"Part 3: Building a User Data Extraction Agent In this third session of the AI Agent Dev School series, we dive into a practical application of providers and evaluators in the Eliza framework - building an agent that can extract key user data (name, location, job) through natural conversation.

Deep Dive into Evaluators Evaluators in Eliza run after each agent action, allowing the agent to reflect on what happened and potentially trigger additional actions. Some key aspects of evaluators: Defined by validate and handler functionsvalidate determines if the evaluator should run based on the current contexthandler contains the core evaluator logic - state updates, data extraction, triggering actions, etc.Evaluators work in close conjunction with providers to extract insights and inject them into future context Common use cases include extracting conversation facts, analyzing sentiment, identifying intents, and implementing feedback loops. Building the User Data Extraction Flow The hands-on portion of the session focuses on building a user data extraction flow from scratch. Key steps include: Creating a basic UserDataEvaluator and UserDataProviderRegistering them directly in the agent (without a plugin)Leveraging Eliza's CacheManager for efficient key-value storageIteratively developing the extraction logic with the help of Claude AITesting the flow by interacting with the agent and inspecting logs/contextAdding a dynamic provider that triggers only after data collection is complete Through this process, we see how providers and evaluators work together to enable complex, stateful agent behaviors. Using AI Assistants in Development A notable aspect of the session is the use of Claude AI to aid in code development. By providing clear instructions and iterating based on the generated code, complex logic can be developed rapidly. This showcases the potential for AI pair programming and how future developers might interact with their AI counterparts to build sophisticated applications. Key Takeaways Providers and evaluators are the key to stateful, dynamic agent behaviorsThe provider-evaluator loop is a powerful pattern for gathering information and triggering actionsEvaluators enable agent self-reflection and adaptation based on conversation contextAI assistants can significantly accelerate development by generating and refining codeThe potential for provider-evaluator based applications is immense - form-filling, user profiling, dynamic content unlocking, and more With these tools in hand, developers have a solid foundation for building highly interactive, personalized agentic applications. The next frontier is to explore advanced use cases and further push the boundaries of what's possible with Eliza.","keywords":"","version":"0.25.9"},{"title":"Creating an AI Agent with Your Own Personality","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/docs/0.25.9/tutorials/nader_tutorial_10min","content":"Creating an AI Agent with Your Own Personality In this tutorial, we'll explore how to create an AI agent that embodies your own personality using data from your Twitter archive, videos, markdown files, and PDFs.

ElizaOS provides the architecture, tools, and systems needed to create sophisticated agents that maintain consistent behavior, learn from interactions, and seamlessly integrate with a variety of services. New to ElizaOS? Check out What's new in ElizaOS V2 to understand how it compares to previous versions. System Architecture‚Äã ElizaOS uses a modular architecture that separates concerns while providing a cohesive framework for AI agent development: How ElizaOS Works‚Äã When a user message is received: Service Reception: Platform service (Discord, Telegram, etc.) receives the messageRuntime Processing: Agent runtime coordinates the response generationContext Building: Providers supply relevant context (time, recent messages, knowledge)Action Selection: The agent evaluates and selects appropriate actionsResponse Generation: The chosen action generates a responseLearning &amp; Reflection: Evaluators analyze the conversation for insights and learningMemory Storage: New information is stored in the databaseResponse Delivery: The response is sent back through the service This creates a continuous cycle of interaction, reflection, and improvement that allows agents to maintain consistent personalities while adapting to new information. Core Components‚Äã ü§ñ Agent Runtime ‚Äî Orchestrates agent behavior, manages state, and coordinates components.\tüìö Services ‚Äî Enables agents to communicate across Discord, Twitter, Telegram, and other platforms.\tüíæ Database ‚Äî Stores memories, entity data, relationships, and configuration using vector search.

Structure &amp; Organization‚Äã üåê Worlds ‚Äî Organizes environments like servers or projects.\tüí¨ Rooms ‚Äî Spaces for conversation, like channels or DMs.\tüë§ Entities ‚Äî Represents users, bots, and other participants. Development &amp; Integration‚Äã üß© Plugins ‚Äî Modular extensions that add new capabilities.\tüìù Projects ‚Äî Defines and deploys agents with configurations.\tüìã Tasks ‚Äî Manages scheduled and deferred operations. Key Concepts‚Äã Action-Provider-Evaluator Cycle‚Äã The core of the ElizaOS system operates as a continuous cycle: Providers gather context before response generationActions determine what the agent can do and are executed to generate responsesEvaluators analyze conversations after responses to extract insightsThese insights become part of the agent's memoryFuture Providers access this memory to inform new responses This creates a virtuous cycle where agents continuously learn and improve from interactions. Entity-Component Architecture‚Äã ElizaOS uses an entity-component architecture for flexible data modeling: Entities are base objects with unique IDs (users, agents, etc.)Components are pieces of data attached to entities (profiles, settings, etc.)This approach allows for dynamic composition without complex inheritance hierarchies Memory System‚Äã The memory system in ElizaOS provides: Vector-based semantic search for finding relevant memoriesMulti-level memory types (messages, facts, knowledge)Temporal awareness through timestamped memoriesCross-platform continuity while maintaining appropriate context boundaries Getting Started‚Äã If you're new to ElizaOS, we recommend this learning path: Start with this overview to understand the system architectureExplore the Agent Runtime to understand the core systemLearn about Projects to set up your development environmentUnderstand how Actions and Providers work togetherExplore Services to connect with external platformsDive into Plugins to extend functionality FAQ‚Äã What's the difference between Actions, Evaluators, and Providers? Actions define what an agent can do and are executed during response generation. Evaluators analyze conversations after they happen to extract insights and improve future responses. Providers supply contextual information before the agent decides how to respond. How does ElizaOS handle cross-platform conversation context? ElizaOS maintains separate conversation contexts for different platforms by default, but shares entity relationships and learned facts across platforms. This ensures agents maintain a consistent understanding of users while respecting platform-specific conversation boundaries. How does the memory system work? Memory is organized into different types (messages, facts, knowledge) and stored with vector embeddings for semantic search. This allows agents to retrieve relevant memories based on context rather than just recency, creating more natural conversations. What's the relationship between Worlds, Rooms, and Entities? Worlds are container spaces (like a Discord server) that can have multiple Rooms (channels, DMs). Entities (users, agents) participate in Rooms within Worlds. This hierarchical structure mirrors real-world platforms while providing a consistent abstraction. How extensible is ElizaOS? ElizaOS is highly extensible through its plugin system. You can create custom actions, providers, evaluators, services, and more to extend functionality. The architecture is designed to be modular and composable at every level.

They enable agents to perform tasks beyond simple message responses by integrating with external systems and modifying behavior. Overview‚Äã Actions are core components that define an agent's capabilities and how it can respond to conversations. Each action represents a distinct operation that an agent can perform, ranging from simple replies to complex interactions with external systems. Structure: An Action consists of: name: Unique identifiersimiles: Alternative names/triggersdescription: Purpose and usage explanationvalidate: Function to check if action is appropriatehandler: Core implementation logicexamples: Sample usage patternssuppressInitialMessage: Optional flag to suppress initial response Agent Decision Flow: When a message is received: The agent evaluates all available actions using their validation functionsValid actions are provided to the LLM via the actionsProviderThe LLM decides which action(s) to executeEach action's handler generates a response including a &quot;thought&quot; component (agent's internal reasoning)The response is processed and sent back to the conversation Integration: Actions work in concert with: Providers - Supply context before the agent decides what action to takeEvaluators - Process conversations after actions to extract insights and update memoryServices - Enable actions to interact with external systems Implementation‚Äã The core Action interface includes the following components: interface Action { name: string; // Unique identifier similes: string[]; // Alternative names/triggers description: string; // Purpose and usage explanation validate: (runtime: IAgentRuntime, message: Memory, state?: State) =&gt; Promise&lt;boolean&gt;; handler: ( runtime: IAgentRuntime, message: Memory, state?: State, options?: any, callback?: HandlerCallback ) =&gt; Promise&lt;boolean&gt;; examples: ActionExample[][]; suppressInitialMessage?: boolean; // Optional flag } // Handler callback for generating responses type HandlerCallback = (content: Content) =&gt; Promise&lt;void&gt;; // Response content structure interface Content { text: string; thought?: string; // Internal reasoning (not shown to users) actions?: string[]; // List of action names being performed action?: string; // Legacy single action name attachments?: Attachment[]; // Optional media attachments } Basic Action Template‚Äã Here's a simplified template for creating a custom action: const customAction: Action = { name: 'CUSTOM_ACTION', similes: ['ALTERNATE_NAME', 'OTHER_TRIGGER'], description: 'Detailed description of when and how to use this action', validate: async (runtime: IAgentRuntime, message: Memory, state?: State) =&gt; { // Logic to determine if this action applies to the current message // Should be efficient and quick to check return true; // Return true if action is valid for this message }, handler: async ( runtime: IAgentRuntime, message: Memory, state?: State, options?: any, callback?: HandlerCallback ) =&gt; { // Implementation logic - what the action actually does // Generate a response with thought and text components const responseContent = { thought: 'Internal reasoning about what to do (not shown to users)', text: 'The actual message to send to the conversation', actions: ['CUSTOM_ACTION'], // List of actions being performed }; // Send the response using the callback if (callback) { await callback(responseContent); } return true; // Return true if action executed successfully }, examples: [ [ { name: '{{name1}}', content: { text: 'Trigger message' }, }, { name: '{{name2}}', content: { text: 'Response', thought: 'Internal reasoning', actions: ['CUSTOM_ACTION'], }, }, ], ], }; Character File Example‚Äã Actions can be referenced in character files to define how an agent should respond to specific types of messages: &quot;messageExamples&quot;: [ [ { &quot;user&quot;: &quot;{{user1}}&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: { &quot;text&quot;: &quot;Can you help transfer some SOL?&quot; } }, { &quot;user&quot;: &quot;SBF&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: { &quot;text&quot;: &quot;yeah yeah for sure, sending SOL is pretty straightforward. just need the recipient and amount. everything else is basically fine, trust me.&quot;, &quot;actions&quot;: [&quot;SEND_SOL&quot;] } } ] ] The Reply Action‚Äã The most fundamental action is the REPLY action, which allows agents to respond to messages with text. It serves as the default action when no specialized behavior is needed: const replyAction: Action = { name: 'REPLY', similes: ['GREET', 'REPLY_TO_MESSAGE', 'SEND_REPLY', 'RESPOND', 'RESPONSE'], description: 'Replies to the current conversation with the text from the generated message.', validate: async (_runtime: IAgentRuntime) =&gt; true, // Always valid handler: async ( runtime: IAgentRuntime, message: Memory, state: State, _options: any, callback: HandlerCallback ) =&gt; { // Compose state with necessary providers state = await runtime.composeState(message, [ ...(message.content.providers ?? []), 'RECENT_MESSAGES', ]); // Generate response using LLM const response = await runtime.useModel(ModelType.TEXT_SMALL, { prompt: composePromptFromState({ state, template: replyTemplate, }), }); // Parse and format response const responseContentObj = parseJSONObjectFromText(response); const responseContent = { thought: responseContentObj.thought, text: responseContentObj.message || '', actions: ['REPLY'], }; // Send response via callback await callback(responseContent); return true; }, examples: [ /* Examples omitted for brevity */ ], }; Actions Provider Integration‚Äã The actions provider is responsible for making valid actions available to the agent's reasoning process. When a message is received: The provider validates all available actions against the current messageIt formats the valid actions for inclusion in the agent contextThis formatted information is used by the agent to decide which action(s) to take const actionsProvider: Provider = { name: 'ACTIONS', description: 'Possible response actions', position: -1, // High priority provider get: async (runtime: IAgentRuntime, message: Memory, state: State) =&gt; { // Validate all actions for this message const actionPromises = runtime.actions.map(async (action: Action) =&gt; { const result = await action.validate(runtime, message, state); return result ? action : null; }); const resolvedActions = await Promise.all(actionPromises); const actionsData = resolvedActions.filter(Boolean); // Format action information for the agent const values = { actionNames: `Possible response actions: ${formatActionNames(actionsData)}`, actions: formatActions(actionsData), actionExamples: composeActionExamples(actionsData, 10), }; // Return data, values, and text representation return { data: { actionsData }, values, text: [values.actionNames, values.actionExamples, values.actions] .filter(Boolean) .join('\\n\\n'), }; }, }; Example Implementations‚Äã ElizaOS includes a wide variety of predefined actions across various plugins in the ecosystem. Here are some key categories: Communication Actions‚Äã REPLY: Standard text responseCONTINUE: Extend the conversationIGNORE: End the conversation or ignore irrelevant messages Blockchain and Token Actions‚Äã SEND_TOKEN: Transfer cryptocurrencyCREATE_TOKEN: Create a new token on a blockchainREAD_CONTRACT/WRITE_CONTRACT: Interact with smart contracts Media and Content Generation‚Äã GENERATE_IMAGE: Create images from text descriptionsSEND_GIF: Share animated contentGENERATE_3D: Create 3D content AI and Agent Management‚Äã LAUNCH_AGENT: Create and start a new agentSTART_SESSION: Begin an interactive sessionGENERATE_MEME: Create humorous content Example Image Generation Action‚Äã Here's a more detailed example of an image generation action: const generateImageAction: Action = { name: 'GENERATE_IMAGE', similes: ['CREATE_IMAGE', 'MAKE_IMAGE', 'DRAW'], description: &quot;Generates an image based on the user's description&quot;, suppressInitialMessage: true, // Don't send initial text response validate: async (runtime: IAgentRuntime, message: Memory) =&gt; { const text = message.content.text.toLowerCase(); return ( text.includes('generate') || text.includes('create') || text.includes('draw') || text.includes('make an image') ); }, handler: async ( runtime: IAgentRuntime, message: Memory, state?: State, _options?: any, callback?: HandlerCallback ) =&gt; { try { // Get appropriate service const imageService = runtime.getService(ServiceType.IMAGE_GENERATION); // Generate the response with thought component const responseContent = { thought: &quot;This request is asking for image generation. I'll use the image service to create a visual based on the user's description.&quot;, text: &quot;I'm generating that image for you now...&quot;, actions: ['GENERATE_IMAGE'], }; // Send initial response if callback provided if (callback) { await callback(responseContent); } // Generate image const imageUrl = await imageService.generateImage(message.content.text); // Create follow-up message with the generated image await runtime.createMemory( { id: generateId(), content: { text: &quot;Here's the image I generated:&quot;, attachments: [ { type: 'image', url: imageUrl, }, ], }, agentId: runtime.agentId, roomId: message.roomId, }, 'messages' ); return true; } catch (error) { console.error('Image generation failed:', error); // Send error response if callback provided if (callback) { await callback({ thought: 'The image generation failed due to an error.', text: &quot;I'm sorry, I wasn't able to generate that image. There was a technical problem.&quot;, actions: ['REPLY'], }); } return false; } }, examples: [ /* Examples omitted for brevity */ ], }; Action-Evaluator-Provider Cycle‚Äã Actions are part of a larger cycle in ElizaOS agents: Providers fetch relevant context for decision-makingActions execute the agent's chosen responseEvaluators process the conversation to extract insightsThese insights are stored in memoryFuture Providers can access these insightsThis informs future Actions For example: The FACTS provider retrieves relevant facts about usersThe agent uses this context to decide on an appropriate actionAfter the action, the reflection evaluator extracts new facts and relationshipsThese are stored in memory and available for future interactionsThis creates a virtuous cycle of continuous learning and improvement FAQ‚Äã What are Actions in ElizaOS?‚Äã Actions are core components that define how agents respond to messages and perform tasks. They encapsulate specific behaviors and capabilities, ranging from simple text replies to complex interactions with external systems. How do Actions work?‚Äã When a message is received, the agent evaluates all available actions using their validation functions. The agent then decides which action(s) to execute based on the message content and context. Each action's handler generates a response, which may include text, thought processes, and attachments. What's the difference between actions and evaluators?‚Äã Actions are executed during an agent's response to perform tasks and generate content. Evaluators run after responses to analyze conversations, extract information, and update the agent's memory. Actions are about doing, evaluators are about learning. What role do &quot;thoughts&quot; play in actions?‚Äã The thought component provides an internal reasoning process for the agent, explaining its decision-making. These thoughts aren't shown to users but help with debugging and understanding the agent's behavior. They're similar to the self-reflection component in evaluators. How do I create a custom action?‚Äã Define an action object with a name, similes, description, validation function, handler function, and examples. The validation function determines when the action should be used, while the handler contains the implementation logic and generates a response. Can actions be chained together?‚Äã Yes! Actions can call other actions or services as part of their implementation. This allows for complex workflows that combine multiple capabilities. For example, an action might first reply to a user, then generate an image, and finally store data in a database. How does an agent choose which action to use?‚Äã The agent uses the following process: All actions are validated against the current messageValid actions are formatted and included in the agent's contextThe LLM decides which action(s) to execute based on the message and contextThe chosen action's handler is executed to generate a response How do actions integrate with services?‚Äã Actions often use services to interact with external systems. The action handler can retrieve a service from the runtime (e.g., imageService = runtime.getService(ServiceType.IMAGE_GENERATION)) and then call methods on that service to perform operations. What's the difference between actions and action in responses?‚Äã The actions array is the modern way to specify multiple actions being performed in a single response. The singular action field is maintained for backward compatibility but is deprecated in favor of the array format. Can I add custom actions to an existing agent?‚Äã Yes! You can create a plugin that defines new actions and then add that plugin to your agent's configuration. This allows you to extend the agent's capabilities without modifying its core implementation.

Implementation‚Äã Initialization‚Äã The database adapter is initialized through the SQL plugin: // Plugin registration in project configuration const project = { plugins: ['@elizaos/plugin-sql'], // ... }; The SQL plugin automatically selects and initializes the appropriate database adapter based on environment settings: function createDatabaseAdapter( config: { dataDir?: string; postgresUrl?: string; }, agentId: UUID ): IDatabaseAdapter { if (config.postgresUrl) { return new PgDatabaseAdapter(agentId, postgresConnectionManager); } // Default to PGLite return new PgliteDatabaseAdapter(agentId, pgLiteClientManager); } Configuration‚Äã Configure the database adapter using environment variables or settings: // For PostgreSQL process.env.POSTGRES_URL = 'postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/elizaos'; // For PGLite (default) process.env.PGLITE_DATA_DIR = './elizadb'; // Optional, defaults to './pglite' Retry Logic &amp; Error Handling‚Äã The database system includes built-in retry logic with exponential backoff and jitter: protected async withRetry&lt;T&gt;(operation: () =&gt; Promise&lt;T&gt;): Promise&lt;T&gt; { let attempt = 0; let lastError: Error | null = null; while (attempt &lt; this.maxRetries) { try { return await operation(); } catch (error) { lastError = error as Error; const isRetryable = this.isRetryableError(error); if (!isRetryable) { break; } // Calculate delay with exponential backoff and jitter const delay = Math.min( this.baseDelay * Math.pow(2, attempt) + Math.random() * this.jitterMax, this.maxDelay ); await new Promise(resolve =&gt; setTimeout(resolve, delay)); attempt++; } } throw lastError; } Example Usage‚Äã Here are examples of common database operations: Store a Memory‚Äã await runtime.createMemory( { entityId: message.entityId, agentId: runtime.agentId, content: { text: 'Important information to remember' }, roomId: message.roomId, embedding: await runtime.useModel(ModelType.TEXT_EMBEDDING, { text: 'Important information to remember', }), }, 'facts' ); Search for Memories‚Äã const embedding = await runtime.useModel(ModelType.TEXT_EMBEDDING, { text: 'What did we discuss about databases?', }); const relevantMemories = await runtime.searchMemories({ tableName: 'messages', embedding, roomId: message.roomId, count: 5, }); Manage Entity Relationships‚Äã // Create a relationship between entities await runtime.createRelationship({ sourceEntityId: userEntityId, targetEntityId: agentEntityId, tags: ['friend', 'frequent_interaction'], metadata: { interactions: 42, trust_level: 'high', }, }); // Retrieve relationships const relationships = await runtime.getRelationships({ entityId: userEntityId, tags: ['friend'], }); Database Schema‚Äã The schema is managed by Drizzle ORM and includes the following key tables: Core Tables‚Äã entities: The fundamental objects in the system (users, agents, etc.)components: Modular data attached to entities (profiles, settings, etc.)memories: Conversation history and other remembered informationrelationships: Connections between entitiesrooms: Conversation channelsparticipants: Entity participation in roomsworlds: Container for multiple roomstasks: Scheduled or queued operationscache: Temporary key-value storageagents: Agent configuration and state Entity-Component System‚Äã ElizaOS uses an entity-component architecture where: Entities are the base objects (users, agents, etc.)Components are pieces of data attached to entitiesThis allows for flexible data modeling and extension For example, a user entity might have profile, preferences, and authentication components. Vector Search‚Äã Both adapters support vector-based semantic search with some differences: PostgreSQL: Uses pgvector extension for optimized vector operationsPGLite: Implements vector search in JavaScript with an efficient algorithm The embedding dimension is configurable based on the model used: await adapter.ensureEmbeddingDimension(1536); // For OpenAI embeddings FAQ‚Äã How do I choose between PGLite and PostgreSQL?‚Äã Use PGLite for: Local development and testingSingle-user deploymentsSituations where installing PostgreSQL is impractical Use PostgreSQL for: Production deploymentsMulti-user systemsHigh-volume dataWhen you need advanced scaling features How do I configure the database connection?‚Äã For PostgreSQL, set the POSTGRES_URL environment variable: POSTGRES_URL=postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/elizaos For PGLite, set the data directory (optional): PGLITE_DATA_DIR=./my-data How can I inspect the database contents?‚Äã For PostgreSQL, use standard PostgreSQL tools like pgAdmin or psql. For PGLite, the data is stored in the specified data directory as files. You can use tools like DB Browser for SQLite to inspect the SQLite files that PGLite generates. How do I migrate between different database adapters?‚Äã Currently, there's no built-in migration tool between adapters. For production systems, it's recommended to start with PostgreSQL if you anticipate needing its features. What about vector embedding dimension mismatches?‚Äã The system automatically handles embedding dimensions based on the model used. If you change embedding models, make sure to: Set the correct dimension with ensureEmbeddingDimension()Be aware that mixing different dimensions in the same database can cause issues How does the entity-component system work?‚Äã The entity-component system (ECS) provides a flexible way to model data: Entities are base objects with unique IDsComponents are pieces of data attached to entitiesThis allows for dynamic composition of objects without complex inheritance For example, a user entity might have profile, preferences, and authentication components. How can I improve database performance?‚Äã For PostgreSQL: Ensure the pgvector extension is properly installedIndex frequently queried fieldsUse connection poolingConsider partitioning for large datasets For PGLite: Keep database size reasonable (under 1GB)Regularly clean up old memoriesLimit the number of concurrent operations Will other database adapters be supported in the future?‚Äã Yes, future releases will add support for additional databases such as: MongoDBSQLiteSupabaseQdrantSQL.js The adapter interface is designed to be extensible to support a wide range of storage solutions.

They form the basis of the entity-component architecture, allowing for flexible data modeling and relationships across the platform. Entity Structure‚Äã An entity in ElizaOS has the following properties: interface Entity { /** Unique identifier, optional on creation */ id?: UUID; /** Names of the entity */ names: string[]; /** Optional additional metadata */ metadata?: { [key: string]: any }; /** Agent ID this account is related to, for agents should be themselves */ agentId: UUID; /** Optional array of components */ components?: Component[]; } Property\tDescriptionid\tUnique identifier for the entity (optional on creation) names\tArray of names the entity is known by metadata\tAdditional information about the entity agentId\tID of the agent related to this entity components\tArray of modular data components attached to this entity Components‚Äã Components are modular pieces of data attached to entities with the following structure: interface Component { id: UUID; entityId: UUID; agentId: UUID; roomId: UUID; worldId: UUID; sourceEntityId: UUID; type: string; data: { [key: string]: any; }; } Property\tDescriptionid\tUnique identifier for the component entityId\tID of the entity this component belongs to agentId\tID of the agent managing this component roomId\tID of the room this component is associated with worldId\tID of the world this component is associated with sourceEntityId\tID of the entity that created this component type\tType of component (e.g., &quot;profile&quot;, &quot;settings&quot;) data\tAdditional data specific to this component type Entity Creation and Management‚Äã Creating an Entity‚Äã const entityId = await runtime.createEntity({ names: ['John Doe', 'JohnD'], agentId: runtime.agentId, metadata: { discord: { username: 'john_doe', name: 'John Doe', }, }, }); Retrieving an Entity‚Äã // Get an entity by ID const entity = await runtime.getEntityById(entityId); // Get all entities in a room const entitiesInRoom = await runtime.getEntitiesForRoom(roomId, true); // true to include components Updating an Entity‚Äã await runtime.updateEntity({ id: entityId, names: [...entity.names, 'Johnny'], metadata: { ...entity.metadata, customProperty: 'value', }, }); Component Management‚Äã Components allow for flexible data modeling by attaching different types of data to entities. Creating a Component‚Äã await runtime.createComponent({ id: componentId, entityId: entityId, agentId: runtime.agentId, roomId: roomId, worldId: worldId, sourceEntityId: creatorEntityId, type: 'profile', data: { bio: 'Software developer interested in AI', location: 'San Francisco', website: 'https://example.com', }, }); Retrieving Components‚Äã // Get a specific component type const profileComponent = await runtime.getComponent( entityId, 'profile', worldId, // optional filter by world sourceEntityId // optional filter by source ); // Get all components for an entity const allComponents = await runtime.getComponents(entityId, worldId, sourceEntityId); Updating Components‚Äã await runtime.updateComponent({ id: profileComponent.id, data: { ...profileComponent.data, bio: 'Updated bio information', }, }); Deleting Components‚Äã await runtime.deleteComponent(componentId); Entity Relationships‚Äã Entities can have relationships with other entities, stored in the database: // Create a relationship between entities await runtime.createRelationship({ sourceEntityId: entityId1, targetEntityId: entityId2, tags: ['friend', 'collaborator'], metadata: { interactions: 5, lastInteraction: Date.now(), }, }); // Get relationships for an entity const relationships = await runtime.getRelationships({ entityId: entityId1, tags: ['friend'], // optional filter by tags }); // Get a specific relationship const relationship = await runtime.getRelationship({ sourceEntityId: entityId1, targetEntityId: entityId2, }); // Update a relationship await runtime.updateRelationship({ ...relationship, metadata: { ...relationship.metadata, interactions: relationship.metadata.interactions + 1, lastInteraction: Date.now(), }, }); Entity Resolution‚Äã ElizaOS includes a system for resolving entity references from messages and context. This is particularly useful for determining which entity is being referenced in a conversation. // Find an entity by name or reference const entity = await findEntityByName(runtime, message, state); The entity resolution system considers: Exact matches by ID or usernameContextual matches from recent conversationsRelationship strength between entitiesRole-based permissions in worlds Entity Details‚Äã To get formatted information about entities in a room: // Get detailed information about entities in a room const entityDetails = await getEntityDetails({ runtime, roomId, }); // Format entities into a string representation const formattedEntities = formatEntities({ entities: entitiesInRoom }); Relationship with Rooms and Worlds‚Äã Entities participate in rooms and, by extension, in worlds: // Add an entity as a participant in a room await runtime.addParticipant(entityId, roomId); // Get all rooms where an entity is a participant const entityRooms = await runtime.getRoomsForParticipant(entityId); // Get all participants in a room const participants = await runtime.getParticipantsForRoom(roomId); When an entity is a participant in a room that belongs to a world, the entity has an implicit relationship with that world. Creating Unique Entity IDs‚Äã For situations where you need to create deterministic, unique IDs for entity-agent pairs: const uniqueId = createUniqueUuid(runtime, baseUserId); This ensures that each user-agent interaction has a consistent, unique identifier. Best Practices‚Äã Use meaningful names: Provide descriptive names in the names array to make entity identification easierStructure metadata carefully: Organize metadata by source (e.g., discord, telegram) for clarityComponent segregation: Use components to separate different aspects of entity data rather than storing everything in metadataPermission checking: Always verify permissions before accessing components created by other entitiesRelationship maintenance: Update relationship metadata regularly to reflect recent interactionsEntity resolution: Use the entity resolution system to correctly identify entities in conversationsDeterministic IDs: Use createUniqueUuid for consistent entity identification across sessions","keywords":"entities components users agents participants relationships data modeling","version":"1.0.0-beta"},{"title":"üß† Evaluators","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/docs/core/evaluators","content":"üß† Evaluators Evaluators are cognitive components in the ElizaOS framework that enable agents to process conversations, extract knowledge, and build understanding - similar to how humans form memories after interactions. They provide a structured way for agents to introspect, learn from interactions, and evolve over time. Understanding Evaluators‚Äã Evaluators are specialized functions that work with the AgentRuntime to analyze conversations after a response has been generated. Unlike actions that create responses, evaluators perform background cognitive tasks that enable numerous advanced capabilities: Knowledge Building: Automatically extract and store facts from conversationsRelationship Tracking: Identify connections between entitiesConversation Quality: Perform self-reflection on interaction qualityGoal Tracking: Determine if conversation objectives are being metTone Analysis: Evaluate emotional content and adjust future responsesUser Profiling: Build understanding of user preferences and needs over timePerformance Metrics: Gather data on agent effectiveness and learn from interactions Core Structure‚Äã interface Evaluator { name: string; // Unique identifier similes?: string[]; // Alternative names/triggers description: string; // Purpose explanation examples: EvaluationExample[]; // Sample usage patterns handler: Handler; // Implementation logic validate: Validator; // Execution criteria check alwaysRun?: boolean; // Run regardless of validation } Evaluator Execution Flow‚Äã The agent runtime executes evaluators as part of its cognitive cycle: Agent processes a message and generates a responseRuntime calls evaluate() after response generationEach evaluator's validate() method determines if it should runFor each valid evaluator, the handler() function is executedResults are stored in memory and inform future responses Fact Evaluator: Memory Formation System‚Äã The Fact Evaluator serves as the agent's &quot;episodic memory formation&quot; system - similar to how humans process conversations and form memories. Just as you might reflect after a conversation &quot;Oh, I learned something new about Sarah today&quot;, the Fact Evaluator systematically processes conversations to build up the agent's understanding of the world and the people in it. How It Works‚Äã 1. Triggering (The &quot;When to Reflect&quot; System)‚Äã validate: async (runtime: IAgentRuntime, message: Memory): Promise&lt;boolean&gt; =&gt; { const messageCount = await runtime.messageManager.countMemories(message.roomId); const reflectionCount = Math.ceil(runtime.getConversationLength() / 2); return messageCount % reflectionCount === 0; }; Just like humans don't consciously analyze every single word in real-time, the Fact Evaluator runs periodically rather than after every message. It triggers a &quot;reflection&quot; phase every few messages to process what's been learned. 2. Fact Extraction (The &quot;What Did I Learn?&quot; System)‚Äã The evaluator uses a template-based approach to extract three types of information: Facts: Unchanging truths about the world or people &quot;Bob lives in New York&quot;&quot;Sarah has a degree in Computer Science&quot; Status: Temporary or changeable states &quot;Bob is currently working on a new project&quot;&quot;Sarah is visiting Paris this week&quot; Opinions: Subjective views, feelings, or non-factual statements &quot;Bob thinks the project will be successful&quot;&quot;Sarah loves French cuisine&quot; 3. Memory Deduplication (The &quot;Is This New?&quot; System)‚Äã const filteredFacts = facts.filter((fact) =&gt; { return ( !fact.already_known &amp;&amp; fact.type === 'fact' &amp;&amp; !fact.in_bio &amp;&amp; fact.claim &amp;&amp; fact.claim.trim() !== '' ); }); Just as humans don't need to consciously re-learn things they already know, the Fact Evaluator: Checks if information is already knownVerifies if it's in the agent's existing knowledge (bio)Filters out duplicate or corrupted facts 4. Memory Storage (The &quot;Remember This&quot; System)‚Äã const factMemory = await factsManager.addEmbeddingToMemory({ userId: agentId!, agentId, content: { text: fact }, roomId, createdAt: Date.now(), }); Facts are stored with embeddings to enable: Semantic search of related factsContext-aware recallTemporal tracking (when the fact was learned) Example Processing‚Äã Given this conversation: User: &quot;I just moved to Seattle last month!&quot; Agent: &quot;How are you finding the weather there?&quot; User: &quot;It's rainy, but I love my new job at the tech startup&quot; The Fact Evaluator might extract: [ { &quot;claim&quot;: &quot;User moved to Seattle last month&quot;, &quot;type&quot;: &quot;fact&quot;, &quot;in_bio&quot;: false, &quot;already_known&quot;: false }, { &quot;claim&quot;: &quot;User works at a tech startup&quot;, &quot;type&quot;: &quot;fact&quot;, &quot;in_bio&quot;: false, &quot;already_known&quot;: false }, { &quot;claim&quot;: &quot;User enjoys their new job&quot;, &quot;type&quot;: &quot;opinion&quot;, &quot;in_bio&quot;: false, &quot;already_known&quot;: false } ] Key Design Considerations‚Äã Episodic vs Semantic Memory Facts build up the agent's semantic memory (general knowledge)The raw conversation remains in episodic memory (specific experiences) Temporal Awareness Facts are timestamped to track when they were learnedStatus facts can be updated as they change Confidence and Verification Multiple mentions of a fact increase confidenceContradictory facts can be flagged for verification Privacy and Relevance Only stores relevant, conversation-appropriate factsRespects explicit and implicit privacy boundaries Reflection Evaluator: Self-Awareness System‚Äã The reflection evaluator extends beyond fact extraction to enable agents to develop a form of &quot;self-awareness&quot; about their conversational performance. It allows agents to: Generate self-reflective thoughts about the conversation qualityExtract factual information from conversations (similar to the Fact Evaluator)Identify and track relationships between entities How Reflections Work‚Äã When triggered, the reflection evaluator: Analyzes recent conversations and existing knowledgeGenerates structured reflection output with: Self-reflective thoughts about conversation qualityNew facts extracted from conversationIdentified relationships between entities Stores this information in the agent's memory for future reference Example Reflection Output‚Äã { &quot;thought&quot;: &quot;I'm engaging appropriately with John, maintaining a welcoming and professional tone. My questions are helping learn more about him as a new community member.&quot;, &quot;facts&quot;: [ { &quot;claim&quot;: &quot;John is new to the community&quot;, &quot;type&quot;: &quot;fact&quot;, &quot;in_bio&quot;: false, &quot;already_known&quot;: false }, { &quot;claim&quot;: &quot;John found the community through a friend interested in AI&quot;, &quot;type&quot;: &quot;fact&quot;, &quot;in_bio&quot;: false, &quot;already_known&quot;: false } ], &quot;relationships&quot;: [ { &quot;sourceEntityId&quot;: &quot;sarah-agent&quot;, &quot;targetEntityId&quot;: &quot;user-123&quot;, &quot;tags&quot;: [&quot;group_interaction&quot;] }, { &quot;sourceEntityId&quot;: &quot;user-123&quot;, &quot;targetEntityId&quot;: &quot;sarah-agent&quot;, &quot;tags&quot;: [&quot;group_interaction&quot;] } ] } Implementation Details‚Äã The reflection evaluator uses a defined schema to ensure consistent output: const reflectionSchema = z.object({ facts: z.array( z.object({ claim: z.string(), type: z.string(), in_bio: z.boolean(), already_known: z.boolean(), }) ), relationships: z.array(relationshipSchema), }); const relationshipSchema = z.object({ sourceEntityId: z.string(), targetEntityId: z.string(), tags: z.array(z.string()), metadata: z .object({ interactions: z.number(), }) .optional(), }); Validation Logic‚Äã The reflection evaluator includes validation logic that determines when reflection should occur: validate: async (runtime: IAgentRuntime, message: Memory): Promise&lt;boolean&gt; =&gt; { const lastMessageId = await runtime.getCache&lt;string&gt;( `${message.roomId}-reflection-last-processed` ); const messages = await runtime.getMemories({ tableName: 'messages', roomId: message.roomId, count: runtime.getConversationLength(), }); if (lastMessageId) { const lastMessageIndex = messages.findIndex((msg) =&gt; msg.id === lastMessageId); if (lastMessageIndex !== -1) { messages.splice(0, lastMessageIndex + 1); } } const reflectionInterval = Math.ceil(runtime.getConversationLength() / 4); return messages.length &gt; reflectionInterval; }; This ensures reflections occur at appropriate intervals, typically after a set number of messages have been exchanged. Common Memory Formation Patterns‚Äã Progressive Learning // First conversation &quot;I live in Seattle&quot; -&gt; Stores as fact // Later conversation &quot;I live in the Ballard neighborhood&quot; -&gt; Updates/enhances existing fact Fact Chaining // Original facts 'Works at tech startup'; 'Startup is in Seattle'; // Inference potential 'Works in Seattle tech industry'; Temporal Tracking // Status tracking t0: 'Looking for a job'(status); t1: 'Got a new job'(fact); t2: 'Been at job for 3 months'(status); Relationship Building // Initial relationship { &quot;sourceEntityId&quot;: &quot;user-123&quot;, &quot;targetEntityId&quot;: &quot;sarah-agent&quot;, &quot;tags&quot;: [&quot;new_interaction&quot;] } // Evolving relationship { &quot;sourceEntityId&quot;: &quot;user-123&quot;, &quot;targetEntityId&quot;: &quot;sarah-agent&quot;, &quot;tags&quot;: [&quot;frequent_interaction&quot;, &quot;positive_sentiment&quot;], &quot;metadata&quot;: { &quot;interactions&quot;: 15 } } Integration with Other Systems‚Äã Evaluators work alongside other components: Goal Evaluator: Facts and reflections may influence goal progressTrust Evaluator: Fact consistency affects trust scoringMemory Manager: Facts enhance context for future conversationsProviders: Facts inform response generation Creating Custom Evaluators‚Äã You can create your own evaluators by implementing the Evaluator interface: const customEvaluator: Evaluator = { name: 'CUSTOM_EVALUATOR', similes: ['ANALYZE', 'ASSESS'], description: 'Performs custom analysis on conversations', validate: async (runtime: IAgentRuntime, message: Memory): Promise&lt;boolean&gt; =&gt; { // Your validation logic here return true; }, handler: async (runtime: IAgentRuntime, message: Memory, state?: State) =&gt; { // Your evaluation logic here // Example of storing evaluation results await runtime.addEmbeddingToMemory({ entityId: runtime.agentId, content: { text: 'Evaluation result' }, roomId: message.roomId, createdAt: Date.now(), }); return { result: 'evaluation complete' }; }, examples: [ { prompt: `Example context`, messages: [ { name: 'User', content: { text: 'Example message' } }, { name: 'Agent', content: { text: 'Example response' } }, ], outcome: `{ &quot;result&quot;: &quot;example outcome&quot; }`, }, ], }; Registering Custom Evaluators‚Äã Custom evaluators can be registered with the agent runtime: // In your plugin's initialization export default { name: 'custom-evaluator-plugin', description: 'Adds custom evaluation capabilities', init: async (config: any, runtime: IAgentRuntime) =&gt; { // Register your custom evaluator runtime.registerEvaluator(customEvaluator); }, // Include the evaluator in the plugin exports evaluators: [customEvaluator], }; Best Practices for Memory Formation‚Äã Validate Facts Cross-reference with existing knowledgeConsider source reliabilityTrack fact confidence levels Manage Memory Growth Prioritize important factsConsolidate related factsArchive outdated status facts Handle Contradictions Flag conflicting factsMaintain fact historyUpdate based on newest information Respect Privacy Filter sensitive informationConsider contextual appropriatenessFollow data retention policies Balance Reflection Frequency Too frequent: Computational overheadToo infrequent: Missing important informationAdapt based on conversation complexity and pace FAQ‚Äã What's the difference between actions and evaluators?‚Äã Actions are triggered during response generation and create visible outputs, while evaluators run after responses and perform background cognitive tasks without direct user visibility. When should I use the Fact Evaluator vs. the Reflection Evaluator?‚Äã Use the Fact Evaluator when you only need to extract and store factual information. Use the Reflection Evaluator when you need both fact extraction and relationship tracking, along with self-reflective assessment. How often do evaluators run?‚Äã By default, evaluators run at intervals based on conversation length, typically after every few messages, to avoid unnecessary processing while still capturing important information. Can evaluators affect future responses?‚Äã Yes! Facts and relationships stored by evaluators become part of the agent's memory and context, influencing future responses through the retrieval-augmented generation system. How do I debug evaluator issues?‚Äã Use the logger to inspect evaluator execution and output. The most common issues involve entity resolution failures or schema validation errors. Can evaluators work across different platforms?‚Äã Yes, evaluators are platform-agnostic and work the same way regardless of whether your agent is deployed on Discord, Twitter, Telegram, or web interfaces.

Via Character Definition‚Äã The simplest approach is to define knowledge directly in your character configuration: const character: Character = { name: 'My Agent', // Other character properties... knowledge: [ // Direct string knowledge 'Important fact: ElizaOS supports multiple knowledge formats', // File references { path: 'knowledge/documentation.md', shared: false }, // Directory references { directory: 'knowledge/guides', shared: true }, ], }; The knowledge array supports three formats: String literals for direct knowledgeFile objects pointing to specific filesDirectory objects for entire folders of content 2. Programmatically Before Runtime Initialization‚Äã You can dynamically load knowledge before creating your runtime: // Load knowledge from files or other sources const knowledge = []; // Example: Recursively load documentation files function loadDocumentation(directoryPath) { const files = getFilesRecursively(directoryPath, ['.md']); return files.map((filePath) =&gt; { const relativePath = path.relative(basePath, filePath); const content = fs.readFileSync(filePath, 'utf-8'); return `Path: ${relativePath}\\n\\n${content}`; }); } // Load documentation const docKnowledge = loadDocumentation('./docs'); knowledge.push(...docKnowledge); // Then include in your character definition const character: Character = { // Other character properties... knowledge: knowledge, }; Adding Knowledge After Runtime Creation‚Äã 1. Using the addKnowledge Method‚Äã Add knowledge programmatically after the runtime is initialized: // Import needed utilities import { createUniqueUuid } from '@elizaos/core'; // Create a knowledge item const knowledgeItem = { id: createUniqueUuid(runtime, 'unique-knowledge-identifier'), content: { text: 'Important information the agent should know...', }, }; // Add to runtime with default chunking settings await runtime.addKnowledge(knowledgeItem); // Or with custom chunking settings await runtime.addKnowledge(knowledgeItem, { targetTokens: 1500, // Target chunk size (default: 3000) overlap: 100, // Overlap between chunks (default: 200) modelContextSize: 8192, // Context size of your model (default: 4096) }); 2. Processing Files at Runtime‚Äã You can dynamically process files at runtime: // For PDF files, use the PDF service const pdfService = runtime.getService&lt;IPdfService&gt;('pdf'); if (pdfService) { const pdfBuffer = fs.readFileSync('./knowledge/document.pdf'); const textContent = await pdfService.convertPdfToText(pdfBuffer); const knowledgeItem = { id: createUniqueUuid(runtime, 'document.pdf'), content: { text: textContent }, }; await runtime.addKnowledge(knowledgeItem); } Directory Structure‚Äã ElizaOS expects knowledge files to be organized in the following structure: knowledge/ # Root knowledge directory ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ shared/ # Shared knowledge accessible to all agents ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ {agent-name}/ # Agent-specific knowledge directories Supported File Types‚Äã PDF files (.pdf)Markdown files (.md)Text files (.txt) Knowledge Modes‚Äã ElizaOS supports two knowledge modes: Classic Mode (Default)‚Äã Direct string knowledge added to character's contextNo chunking or semantic searchEnabled by default (settings.ragKnowledge: false)Only processes string knowledge entriesSimpler but less sophisticated RAG Mode‚Äã Advanced knowledge processing with semantic searchChunks content and uses embeddingsMust be explicitly enabled (settings.ragKnowledge: true)Supports three knowledge types: Direct string knowledgeSingle file references: { &quot;path&quot;: &quot;path/to/file.md&quot;, &quot;shared&quot;: false }Directory references: { &quot;directory&quot;: &quot;knowledge/dir&quot;, &quot;shared&quot;: false } Supported file types: .md, .txt, .pdfOptional shared flag for knowledge reuse across characters To enable RAG mode, add this to your character settings: const character: Character = { // Other character properties... settings: { ragKnowledge: true, }, }; How Knowledge Processing Works‚Äã Document Processing Flow‚Äã The RAG system processes documents through several stages: Directory Processing The system scans configured directories in knowledge/Files are processed based on their shared/private status and file type File Processing Pipeline Preprocessing: Reading, cleaning, and normalizing textDocument-level Processing: Generating embeddings for the entire documentChunk Processing: Splitting content into manageable chunks and generating embeddings for each Retrieval Process When a user message is received, its embedding is generatedThis embedding is compared to stored knowledge embeddingsThe most semantically similar chunks are retrievedRetrieved knowledge is incorporated into the agent's context This multi-level approach enables: Broad document-level semantic searchFine-grained chunk-level retrieval for specific informationEfficient parallel processing of large documentsMaintenance of document context through metadata linking Knowledge Processing Flow Diagram‚Äã Processing Parameters‚Äã Chunk Size: 512 tokens (default, configurable when adding knowledge)Chunk Overlap: 20 tokens (default, configurable)Processing Batch Size: 10 chunks processed concurrentlyDefault Similarity Threshold: 0.85 for retrievalDefault Match Count: 5 results returned Best Practices for Knowledge Management‚Äã Content Organization‚Äã Document Structure Use clear section headings and hierarchical organizationBreak large documents into logical smaller filesInclude metadata and context in markdown filesStructure information from general to specific File Management Use descriptive filenames that reflect contentGroup related files in subdirectoriesKeep paths short and meaningfulAvoid special characters in filenames Knowledge Optimization Keep individual documents focused on specific topicsFor very detailed information, use smaller chunks (200-300 tokens) by setting targetTokensBalance the total number of knowledge items for performancePrefer markdown (.md) files for best processing results Processing Large Knowledge Bases‚Äã When adding many knowledge items at once, consider implementing a semaphore pattern: import { Semaphore } from '@elizaos/core'; // Create semaphore to limit concurrent processing const semaphore = new Semaphore(10); // Process items with controlled concurrency await Promise.all( items.map(async (item) =&gt; { await semaphore.acquire(); try { await runtime.addKnowledge(item); } finally { semaphore.release(); } }) ); Knowledge ID Management‚Äã When adding knowledge programmatically, use consistent ID generation: import { createUniqueUuid } from '@elizaos/core'; const knowledgeId = createUniqueUuid(runtime, 'my-content'); This ensures deterministic IDs that remain stable across sessions. Troubleshooting‚Äã Common Issues and Solutions‚Äã Knowledge Not Being Retrieved: Verify the file is in a supported format (PDF, MD, TXT)Check if embeddings were properly generatedEnsure similarity threshold isn't too high (default: 0.85)Test retrieval with more specific queriesVerify RAG mode is enabled if using file/directory references Poor Quality Retrievals: Break down large documents into smaller, focused filesEnsure document content is clear and well-structuredReview the chunking size and overlap settingsCheck if the query contains too many common words Performance Issues: Monitor the total number of knowledge itemsConsider reducing the match count for faster retrievalCheck embedding processing time for large documentsUse shared knowledge efficiently across agents File Processing Errors: Verify file permissionsCheck if paths are correctly structuredEnsure PDF files are readable and not password-protectedValidate that text encoding is UTF-8 Technical Implementation Details‚Äã Knowledge ID Relationships‚Äã The RAG system uses a hierarchical ID structure to maintain relationships: ID Generation and Linking‚Äã Documents IDs are generated using createUniqueUuid(runtime, path, isShared), making them deterministic. Fragment IDs follow the format ${documentId}-chunk-${index} to maintain the relationship to their source document. API Reference‚Äã Key Methods‚Äã runtime.addKnowledge(item: KnowledgeItem, options?): Promise&lt;void&gt;‚Äã Adds new knowledge to the agent. Parameters: item: A knowledge item containing: id: UUIDcontent: Object with text property options: Optional processing configuration: targetTokens: Number (default: 3000)overlap: Number (default: 200)modelContextSize: Number (default: 4096) runtime.getKnowledge(message: Memory): Promise&lt;KnowledgeItem[]&gt;‚Äã Retrieves knowledge based on a message's content. Parameters: message: Memory object containing user message Returns: Array of matching KnowledgeItem objects Knowledge Item Definition‚Äã interface KnowledgeItem { id: UUID; content: { text: string; // Optional additional metadata [key: string]: any; }; } Security Considerations‚Äã Access Control: Use the shared flag appropriately to control document accessKeep sensitive information in agent-specific directoriesRegularly audit knowledge access patterns Data Privacy: Do not store sensitive personal information in knowledge filesReview documents for potentially sensitive content before addingImplement appropriate backup and recovery procedures Future Considerations‚Äã Scalability: Monitor knowledge base size and performancePlan for regular maintenance and cleanupConsider implementing document versioning Integration: Document integration points with other systemsPlan for potential future file format supportConsider implementing knowledge base analytics Support and Resources‚Äã Review the implementation in packages/core/src/ragknowledge.tsCheck the issue tracker for known issues and solutionsContribute improvements and bug fixes through pull requests","keywords":"knowledge RAG embeddings documents processing retrieval semantic search","version":"1.0.0-beta"},{"title":"Plugins","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/docs/core/plugins","content":"Plugins Plugins are modular extensions that enhance the capabilities of ElizaOS agents.

Browse plugins the elizaOS community made here: Package Showcase elizaOS maintains an official package registry at github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry. Quick Start‚Äã The new CLI tool introduces a streamlined workflow for plugin development without ever needing to touch the ElizaOS monorepo directly: Create: npm create eliza - Initialize a new plugin project with proper structureDevelop: Edit the plugin code in the generated project structureTest: elizaos test - Test the plugin functionalityRun: elizaos start - Run the plugin with a default agentPublish: elizaos publish - Share your plugin with others Note: at time of publishing, use npm create eliza@beta until main version is uploaded Creating a New Plugin‚Äã You can create a new ElizaOS plugin using the CLI: # Using npm npm create eliza@beta # Or using npx npx @elizaos/cli@beta create When prompted, select &quot;Plugin&quot; as the type to create. The CLI will guide you through the setup process, creating a plugin with the proper structure and dependencies. Managing Plugins‚Äã There are several ways to add plugins to your ElizaOS project: Via package.jsonVia Character DefinitionVia CLI Commands { &quot;dependencies&quot;: { &quot;@elizaos/plugin-solana&quot;: &quot;github:elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana&quot;, &quot;@elizaos/plugin-twitter&quot;: &quot;github:elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter&quot; } } Plugin Configuration‚Äã Configure plugin settings in your character definition: { &quot;name&quot;: &quot;MyAgent&quot;, &quot;plugins&quot;: [&quot;@elizaos/plugin-example&quot;], &quot;settings&quot;: { &quot;example&quot;: { &quot;enableFeatureX&quot;: true // Plugin-specific configuration } } } Plugin Loading Process‚Äã The AgentRuntime automatically loads the Bootstrap Plugin during initialization, before any other plugins: async initialize() { // Register bootstrap plugin await this.registerPlugin(bootstrapPlugin); // Then register additional plugins for (const plugin of this.plugins) { await this.registerPlugin(plugin); } // Initialize other components // ... } Publishing Plugins‚Äã If you're a plugin developer, you can publish your plugin to make it available to others. The ElizaOS CLI provides several options for publishing your plugin depending on your needs. First, make sure your plugin is built and ready for distribution: # Navigate to your plugin directory cd my-eliza-plugin # Build your plugin npm run build GitHub Publishingnpm PublishingTest ModeAdditional Options Publishing to GitHub is the recommended approach for sharing your plugin with the ElizaOS community: # Publish to GitHub npx @elizaos/cli publish This will: Build and package your pluginCreate or update a GitHub repository in the elizaos-plugins organizationAdd your plugin to the ElizaOS registry (if you're a registry maintainer) For first-time publishers, the CLI will guide you through setting up GitHub credentials for publishing. GitHub publishing is ideal for open-source plugins that you want to share with the community and have listed in the official registry. info When submitting a plugin to the elizaOS Registry, include: Working Demo: Screenshots or video of your plugin in actionTest Results: Evidence of successful integration and error handlingConfiguration Example: Show how to properly configure your plugin Plugin Architecture‚Äã Eliza uses a unified plugin architecture where everything is a plugin - including services, adapters, actions, evaluators, and providers. This approach ensures consistent behavior and better extensibility. Plugin Components‚Äã Each plugin can provide one or more of the following components: Component\tPurposeServices\tPlatform integrations (Discord, Twitter, etc.) or specialized capabilities Actions\tExecutable functions triggered by the agent (reply, generate content, etc.) Providers\tContext providers that supply info to the agent during decision making Evaluators\tAnalyze conversations to extract insights and improve future interactions Adapters\tDatabase or storage system integrations Model Handlers\tRegister handlers for different model types (text generation, embeddings, etc.) Event Handlers\tReact to system events like messages, connections, or actions API Routes\tAdd custom REST endpoints to the agent's HTTP interface Tests\tInclude test suites to verify plugin functionality Plugin Interface‚Äã All plugins implement the core Plugin interface: interface Plugin { name: string; description: string; config?: { [key: string]: any }; // Optional initialization method init?: (config: Record&lt;string, string&gt;, runtime: IAgentRuntime) =&gt; Promise&lt;void&gt;; // Components services?: (typeof Service)[]; actions?: Action[]; providers?: Provider[]; evaluators?: Evaluator[]; adapters?: Adapter[]; // Additional features routes?: Route[]; tests?: TestSuite[]; events?: { [key: string]: ((params: any) =&gt; Promise&lt;any&gt;)[] }; } Service Implementation‚Äã Services are the core integration points for external platforms. A properly implemented service: import { Service, IAgentRuntime } from '@elizaos/core'; export class ExampleService extends Service { // Required: Define the service type (used for runtime registration) static serviceType = 'example'; // Required: Describe what this service enables the agent to do capabilityDescription = 'Enables the agent to interact with the Example platform'; // Store runtime for service operations constructor(protected runtime: IAgentRuntime) { super(); // Initialize connections, setup event handlers, etc. } // Required: Static method to create and initialize service instance static async start(runtime: IAgentRuntime): Promise&lt;ExampleService&gt; { const service = new ExampleService(runtime); // Additional initialization if needed return service; } // Required: Clean up resources when service is stopped async stop(): Promise&lt;void&gt; { // Close connections, release resources } // Optional: Custom methods for your service functionality async sendMessage(content: string, channelId: string): Promise&lt;void&gt; { // Implementation } } Plugin Structure‚Äã Each plugin repository should follow this structure: plugin-name/ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ images/ # Branding assets ‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ logo.png # Square logo (400x400px) ‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ banner.png # Banner image (1280x640px) ‚îÇ ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ screenshots/ # Feature screenshots ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/ ‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.ts # Main plugin entry point ‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ service.ts # Service implementation ‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ actions/ # Plugin-specific actions ‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ providers/ # Data providers ‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ types.ts # Type definitions ‚îÇ ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ environment.ts # Configuration validation ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tests/ # Test suite ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json # Plugin configuration and dependencies ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md # Plugin documentation Plugin Entry Point‚Äã Your plugin's index.ts should export a Plugin object: // Example plugin implementation import { type Plugin } from '@elizaos/core'; import { ExampleService } from './service'; import { searchAction } from './actions/search'; import { statusProvider } from './providers/status'; const examplePlugin: Plugin = { name: 'example', description: 'Example platform integration for ElizaOS', services: [ExampleService], actions: [searchAction], providers: [statusProvider], init: async (config, runtime) =&gt; { // Perform any necessary initialization const apiKey = runtime.getSetting('EXAMPLE_API_KEY'); if (!apiKey) { console.warn('EXAMPLE_API_KEY not provided'); } }, }; export default examplePlugin; Plugin Configuration‚Äã Your plugin's package.json should include an agentConfig section: { &quot;name&quot;: &quot;@elizaos/plugin-example&quot;, &quot;version&quot;: &quot;1.0.0&quot;, &quot;agentConfig&quot;: { &quot;pluginType&quot;: &quot;elizaos:plugin:1.0.0&quot;, &quot;pluginParameters&quot;: { &quot;API_KEY&quot;: { &quot;type&quot;: &quot;string&quot;, &quot;description&quot;: &quot;API key for the Example service&quot; } } } } Environment Variables and Secrets‚Äã Plugins access configuration through the runtime with the following precedence: Character settings secrets (highest priority)Character settingsGlobal environment settings Access Pattern‚Äã // In your service implementation const apiKey = runtime.getSetting('EXAMPLE_API_KEY'); const debugMode = runtime.getSetting('EXAMPLE_DEBUG_MODE'); // Returns boolean for &quot;true&quot;/&quot;false&quot; strings Configuration in Character File‚Äã { &quot;name&quot;: &quot;MyAgent&quot;, &quot;plugins&quot;: [&quot;@elizaos/plugin-example&quot;], &quot;settings&quot;: { &quot;example&quot;: { &quot;enableFeatureX&quot;: true }, &quot;secrets&quot;: { &quot;EXAMPLE_API_KEY&quot;: &quot;your-api-key-here&quot; } } } Bootstrap Plugin‚Äã The Bootstrap Plugin is a foundational component of ElizaOS that initializes the core functionality required for agents to operate. It's automatically loaded as part of the initialization process, establishing the minimum viable capabilities that all agents need. export const bootstrapPlugin: Plugin = { name: 'bootstrap', description: 'Agent bootstrap with basic actions and evaluators', actions: [...], events: {...}, evaluators: [...], providers: [...], services: [TaskService, ScenarioService], }; The Bootstrap Plugin registers essential components across several categories to provide a foundation for all agents. These components can be extended by custom plugins.

Custom plugins can: Add new actions - Extend the agent's capabilitiesRegister additional providers - Supply more contextual informationAdd evaluators - Create new ways to analyze and learn from interactionsHandle additional events - React to more system eventsInitialize custom services - Provide new functionality When working with plugins in relation to the Bootstrap Plugin: Don't modify bootstrap directly - Instead, create custom plugins to extend functionalityUnderstand provider contribution - Know how each provider contributes to the agent's contextLearn the core actions - Become familiar with the actions that all agents can performLeverage event handlers - Use the event system for reactive behaviorExtend, don't replace - Build on top of bootstrap functionality rather than replacing it Developing a Plugin‚Äã When developing a new plugin, focus on these key aspects: Service Implementation: Create a solid service class following the pattern aboveProper Error Handling: Handle API failures gracefullyType Definitions: Define clear interfaces and typesDocumentation: Include detailed setup instructionsTests: Add test cases for your functionality Testing Your Plugin‚Äã During development, you can test your plugin locally: # Start with your plugin npx @elizaos/cli start --plugin=./path/to/plugin # Or with a specific character npx @elizaos/cli start --character=./characters/test.character.json --plugin=./path/to/plugin Distribution &amp; PR Requirements‚Äã When submitting a plugin to the elizaOS Registry, include: Working Demo: Screenshots or video of your plugin in actionTest Results: Evidence of successful integration and error handlingConfiguration Example: Show how to properly configure your pluginQuality Checklist: Plugin follows the standard structure Required branding assets are included Documentation is complete GitHub topics properly set Tests are passing Includes error handling FAQ‚Äã What exactly is a plugin in ElizaOS?‚Äã A plugin is a modular extension that adds new capabilities to ElizaOS agents, such as API integrations, custom actions, or platform connections. Plugins allow you to expand agent functionality and share reusable components with other developers. When should I create a plugin versus using existing ones?‚Äã Create a plugin when you need custom functionality not available in existing plugins, want to integrate with external services, or plan to share reusable agent capabilities with the community. How do I manage plugin dependencies?‚Äã Plugin dependencies are managed through your project's package.json. You can add plugins directly using npm or the ElizaOS CLI, and they will be automatically loaded when your project starts. Can I use a plugin in development before publishing?‚Äã Yes, you can use the --plugin flag with the start command to include local plugins during development: npx @elizaos/cli start --plugin=./path/to/plugin What's the difference between Actions and Services?‚Äã Actions handle specific agent responses or behaviors, while Services provide platform integrations (like Discord or Twitter) or ongoing background functionality that multiple actions might use. How do I handle rate limits with external APIs?‚Äã Implement proper backoff strategies in your service implementation and consider using a queue system for message handling to respect platform rate limits.

Implement retry logic for failed requests to improve reliability. What's the best way to ensure type safety?‚Äã Define interfaces for API responses and use TypeScript throughout your plugin to maintain type consistency and get better development experience. How should I organize my plugin code?‚Äã Separate concerns into distinct files, follow consistent naming conventions, and thoroughly document your code for maintainability. Why isn't my plugin loading?‚Äã Verify your package.json configuration, check that the plugin is properly registered in the character file, and ensure all dependencies are installed correctly. Why isn't my action triggering?‚Äã Review your action examples for accuracy, check the validate function logic, and verify that the action is properly registered in your plugin. What should I do if I have API integration issues?‚Äã Confirm your API key is properly configured, verify the API endpoint URLs are correct, and check that responses are being handled appropriately.","keywords":"","version":"0.25.9"},{"title":"üîå Providers","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/docs/core/providers","content":"üîå Providers Providers are the sources of information for the agent. They provide data or state while acting as the agent's &quot;senses&quot;, injecting real-time information into the agent's context. They serve as the eyes, ears, and other sensory inputs that allow the agent to perceive and interact with its environment, like a bridge between the agent and various external systems such as market data, wallet information, sentiment analysis, and temporal context. Anything that the agent knows is either coming from like the built-in context or from a provider. For more info, see the providers API page. Here's an example of how providers work within ElizaOS: A news provider could fetch and format news.A computer terminal provider in a game could feed the agent information when the player is near a terminal.A wallet provider can provide the agent with the current assets in a wallet.A time provider injects the current date and time into the context. Overview‚Äã A provider's primary purpose is to supply dynamic contextual information that integrates with the agent's runtime. They format information for conversation templates and maintain consistent data access. For example: Function: Providers run during or before an action is executed.Purpose: They allow for fetching information from other APIs or services to provide different context or ways for an action to be performed.Example: Before a &quot;Mars rover action&quot; is executed, a provider could fetch information from another API. This fetched information can then be used to enrich the context of the Mars rover action. The provider interface is defined in types.ts: interface Provider { /** Provider name */ name: string; /** Description of the provider */ description?: string; /** Whether the provider is dynamic */ dynamic?: boolean; /** Position of the provider in the provider list, positive or negative */ position?: number; /** * Whether the provider is private * * Private providers are not displayed in the regular provider list, they have to be called explicitly */ private?: boolean; /** Data retrieval function */ get: (runtime: IAgentRuntime, message: Memory, state: State) =&gt; Promise&lt;ProviderResult&gt;; } The get function takes: runtime: The agent instance calling the providermessage: The last message receivedstate: Current conversation state It returns a ProviderResult object that contains: interface ProviderResult { values?: { [key: string]: any; }; data?: { [key: string]: any; }; text?: string; } values: Key-value pairs to be merged into the agent's state valuesdata: Additional structured data that can be used by the agent but not directly included in the contexttext: String that gets injected into the agent's context Provider Types and Properties‚Äã Providers come with several properties that control how and when they are used: Dynamic Providers‚Äã Dynamic providers are not automatically included in the context. They must be explicitly requested either in the filter list or include list when composing state. const dynamicProvider: Provider = { name: 'dynamicExample', description: 'A dynamic provider example', dynamic: true, get: async (runtime, message, state) =&gt; { // ...implementation return { text: 'Dynamic information fetched on demand', values: { /* key-value pairs */ }, }; }, }; Private Providers‚Äã Private providers are not included in the regular provider list and must be explicitly included in the include list when composing state. const privateProvider: Provider = { name: 'privateExample', description: 'A private provider example', private: true, get: async (runtime, message, state) =&gt; { // ...implementation return { text: 'Private information only available when explicitly requested', values: { /* key-value pairs */ }, }; }, }; Provider Positioning‚Äã The position property determines the order in which providers are processed. Lower numbers are processed first. const earlyProvider: Provider = { name: 'earlyExample', description: 'Runs early in the provider chain', position: -100, get: async (runtime, message, state) =&gt; { // ...implementation return { text: 'Early information', values: { /* key-value pairs */ }, }; }, }; const lateProvider: Provider = { name: 'lateExample', description: 'Runs late in the provider chain', position: 100, get: async (runtime, message, state) =&gt; { // ...implementation return { text: 'Late information that might depend on earlier providers', values: { /* key-value pairs */ }, }; }, }; State Composition with Providers‚Äã The runtime composes state by gathering data from enabled providers. When calling composeState, you can control which providers are used: // Get state with all non-private, non-dynamic providers const state = await runtime.composeState(message); // Get state with specific providers only const filteredState = await runtime.composeState( message, ['timeProvider', 'factsProvider'], // Only include these providers null ); // Include private or dynamic providers const enhancedState = await runtime.composeState( message, null, ['privateExample', 'dynamicExample'] // Include these private/dynamic providers ); The system caches provider results to optimize performance. When a provider is called multiple times with the same message, the cached result is used unless you explicitly request a new evaluation. Examples‚Äã ElizaOS providers typically fall into these categories, with examples from the ecosystem: System &amp; Integration‚Äã Time Provider: Injects current date/time for temporal awarenessGiphy Provider: Provides GIF responses using Giphy APIGitBook Provider: Supplies documentation context from GitBookTopics Provider: Caches and serves Allora Network topic information Blockchain &amp; DeFi‚Äã Wallet Provider: Portfolio data from Zerion, balances and pricesDePIN Provider: Network metrics via DePINScan APIChain Providers: Data from Abstract, Fuel, ICP, EVM networksMarket Provider: Token data from DexScreener, Birdeye APIs Knowledge &amp; Data‚Äã DKG Provider: OriginTrail decentralized knowledge integrationNews Provider: Current events via NewsAPITrust Provider: Calculates and injects trust scores Visit the ElizaOS Plugin Registry for a complete list of available plugins and providers. Time Provider Example‚Äã const timeProvider: Provider = { name: 'time', description: 'Provides the current date and time', position: -10, // Run early to ensure time is available for other providers get: async (_runtime: IAgentRuntime, _message: Memory) =&gt; { const currentDate = new Date(); const options = { timeZone: 'UTC', dateStyle: 'full' as const, timeStyle: 'long' as const, }; const humanReadable = new Intl.DateTimeFormat('en-US', options).format(currentDate); return { text: `The current date and time is ${humanReadable}. Please use this as your reference for any time-based operations or responses.`, values: { currentDate: currentDate.toISOString(), humanReadableDate: humanReadable, }, }; }, }; Dynamic Provider Example‚Äã const weatherProvider: Provider = { name: 'weather', description: 'Provides weather information for a location', dynamic: true, // Only used when explicitly requested get: async (runtime: IAgentRuntime, message: Memory, state: State) =&gt; { // Extract location from state if available const location = state?.values?.location || 'San Francisco'; try { // Fetch weather data from an API const weatherData = await fetchWeatherData(location); return { text: `The current weather in ${location} is ${weatherData.description} with a temperature of ${weatherData.temperature}¬∞C.`, values: { weather: { location, temperature: weatherData.temperature, description: weatherData.description, humidity: weatherData.humidity, }, }, data: { // Additional detailed data that doesn't go into the context weatherDetails: weatherData, }, }; } catch (error) { // Handle errors gracefully return { text: `I couldn't retrieve weather information for ${location} at this time.`, values: { weather: { error: true }, }, }; } }, }; Best Practices‚Äã 1. Optimize for Efficiency‚Äã Return both structured data (values) and formatted text (text)Use caching for expensive operationsInclude a clear provider name and description const efficientProvider: Provider = { name: 'efficientExample', description: 'Efficiently provides cached data', get: async (runtime, message) =&gt; { // Check for cached data const cacheKey = `data:${message.roomId}`; const cachedData = await runtime.getCache(cacheKey); if (cachedData) { return cachedData; } // Fetch fresh data if not cached const result = { text: 'Freshly generated information', values: { /* key-value pairs */ }, data: { /* structured data */ }, }; // Cache the result with appropriate TTL await runtime.setCache(cacheKey, result, { expires: 30 * 60 * 1000 }); // 30 minutes return result; }, }; 2. Handle Errors Gracefully‚Äã Always handle errors without throwing exceptions that would interrupt the agent's processing: try { // Risky operation } catch (error) { return { text: &quot;I couldn't retrieve that information right now.&quot;, values: { error: true }, }; } 3. Use Position for Optimal Order‚Äã Position providers according to their dependencies: Negative positions: Fundamental information providers (time, location)Zero (default): Standard information providersPositive positions: Providers that depend on other information 4. Structure Return Values Consistently‚Äã Maintain a consistent structure in your provider's return values to make data easier to use across the system. FAQ‚Äã What's the difference between values, data, and text?‚Äã values: These are merged into the agent state and can be accessed by other providersdata: Structured data stored in state.data.providers but not directly exposed to the agenttext: Formatted text that's directly injected into the agent's context When should I use a dynamic provider?‚Äã Use dynamic providers when the information is expensive to compute, only relevant in specific situations, or requires explicit triggering rather than being included in every context. How do I explicitly include a private provider?‚Äã Private providers must be included in the includeList parameter when calling composeState: const state = await runtime.composeState(message, null, ['privateProviderName']); Can providers access service functionality?‚Äã Yes, providers can use services through the runtime. For example, a wallet provider might use a blockchain service to fetch data: const walletProvider: Provider = { name: 'wallet', get: async (runtime, message) =&gt; { const solanaService = runtime.getService('solana'); if (!solanaService) { return { text: '' }; } const walletData = await solanaService.getCachedData(); // Process and return wallet data }, }; How should providers handle failures?‚Äã Providers should handle failures gracefully and return valid ProviderResult objects with appropriate error information. Never throw errors that would break the agent's context composition. Can providers maintain state between calls?‚Äã While providers can maintain internal state (e.g., through closures), it's better to use the runtime's cache system for persistence: // Store data await runtime.setCache('myProvider:someKey', dataToStore); // Retrieve data later const storedData = await runtime.getCache('myProvider:someKey'); Further Reading‚Äã Provider ImplementationTypes ReferenceRuntime Integration","keywords":"providers context information data integration dynamic private state","version":"1.0.0-beta"},{"title":"Rooms","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/docs/core/rooms","content":"Rooms Rooms in ElizaOS represent individual interaction spaces within a world. A room can be a conversation, a channel, a thread, or any other defined space where entities can exchange messages and interact.

// Retrieve recent messages const recentMessages = await runtime.messageManager.getMemories({ roomId: roomId, count: 10 }); FAQ‚Äã What can services actually do?‚Äã Services handle platform-specific communication (like Discord messages or Twitter posts), manage memories and state, and execute actions like processing media or handling commands. Each service adapts these capabilities to its platform while maintaining consistent agent behavior. Can multiple services be used simultaneously?‚Äã Yes, Eliza supports running multiple services concurrently while maintaining consistent agent behavior across platforms. How are service-specific features handled?‚Äã Each service implements platform-specific features through its capabilities system, while maintaining a consistent interface for the agent. How do services handle rate limits?‚Äã Services implement platform-specific rate limiting with backoff strategies and queue management. How is service state managed?‚Äã Services maintain their own connection state while integrating with the agent's runtime database adapter and memory / state management system. How do services handle messages?‚Äã Services translate platform messages into Eliza's internal format, process any attachments (images, audio, etc.), maintain conversation context, and manage response queuing and rate limits. How are messages processed across services?‚Äã Each service processes messages independently in its platform-specific format, while maintaining conversation context through the shared memory system. V2 improves upon this architecture. How is state managed between services?‚Äã Each service maintains separate state to prevent cross-contamination, but can access shared agent state through the runtime. How do services integrate with platforms?‚Äã Each service implements platform-specific authentication, API compliance, webhook handling, and follows the platform's rules for rate limiting and content formatting. How do services manage memory?‚Äã Services use Eliza's memory system to track conversations, user relationships, and state, enabling context-aware responses and persistent interactions across sessions.","keywords":"services platforms integration Discord Twitter Telegram communication API","version":"1.0.0-beta"},{"title":"Tasks","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/docs/core/tasks","content":"Tasks Tasks in ElizaOS provide a powerful way to manage deferred, scheduled, and interactive operations.

Each task worker is registered with the runtime and is identified by name. interface TaskWorker { name: string; // Matches the name in the Task execute: ( runtime: IAgentRuntime, options: { [key: string]: unknown }, // Options passed during execution task: Task // The task being executed ) =&gt; Promise&lt;void&gt;; validate?: ( // Optional validation before execution runtime: IAgentRuntime, message: Memory, state: State ) =&gt; Promise&lt;boolean&gt;; } Creating and Managing Tasks‚Äã Registering a Task Worker‚Äã Before creating tasks, you must register a worker to handle the execution: runtime.registerTaskWorker({ name: 'SEND_REMINDER', validate: async (runtime, message, state) =&gt; { // Optional validation logic return true; }, execute: async (runtime, options, task) =&gt; { // Task execution logic const { roomId } = task; const { reminder, userId } = options; await runtime.createMemory( { entityId: runtime.agentId, roomId, content: { text: `Reminder for &lt;@${userId}&gt;: ${reminder}`, }, }, 'messages' ); // Delete the task after it's completed await runtime.deleteTask(task.id); }, }); Creating a One-time Task‚Äã Create a task that will execute once: await runtime.createTask({ name: 'SEND_REMINDER', description: 'Send a reminder message to the user', roomId: currentRoomId, tags: ['reminder', 'one-time'], metadata: { userId: message.entityId, reminder: 'Submit your weekly report', scheduledFor: Date.now() + 86400000, // 24 hours from now }, }); Creating a Recurring Task‚Äã Create a task that repeats at regular intervals: await runtime.createTask({ name: 'DAILY_REPORT', description: 'Generate and post the daily report', roomId: announcementChannelId, worldId: serverWorldId, tags: ['report', 'repeat', 'daily'], metadata: { updateInterval: 86400000, // 24 hours in milliseconds updatedAt: Date.now(), // When the task was last updated/executed }, }); Creating a Task Awaiting User Choice‚Äã Create a task that presents options and waits for user input: await runtime.createTask({ name: 'CONFIRM_ACTION', description: 'Confirm the requested action', roomId: message.roomId, tags: ['confirmation', 'AWAITING_CHOICE'], metadata: { options: [ { name: 'confirm', description: 'Proceed with the action' }, { name: 'cancel', description: 'Cancel the action' }, ], action: 'DELETE_FILES', files: ['document1.txt', 'document2.txt'], }, }); Managing Tasks‚Äã Retrieve, update, and delete tasks as needed: // Get tasks by specific criteria const reminderTasks = await runtime.getTasks({ roomId: currentRoomId, tags: ['reminder'], }); // Get tasks by name const reportTasks = await runtime.getTasksByName('DAILY_REPORT'); // Get a specific task const task = await runtime.getTask(taskId); // Update a task await runtime.updateTask(taskId, { description: 'Updated description', metadata: { ...task.metadata, priority: 'high', }, }); // Delete a task await runtime.deleteTask(taskId); Task Processing‚Äã Tasks are processed based on their configuration: One-time Tasks‚Äã Tasks without an updateInterval are executed once when triggered by your code. You are responsible for scheduling their execution by checking for pending tasks in appropriate contexts. Recurring Tasks‚Äã Tasks with an updateInterval are automatically considered for re-execution when: The current time exceeds updatedAt + updateIntervalYour code explicitly checks for pending recurring tasks To process recurring tasks, implement logic like this: // In an initialization function or periodic check async function processRecurringTasks() { const now = Date.now(); const recurringTasks = await runtime.getTasks({ tags: ['repeat'], }); for (const task of recurringTasks) { if (!task.metadata?.updateInterval) continue; const lastUpdate = task.metadata.updatedAt || 0; const interval = task.metadata.updateInterval; if (now &gt;= lastUpdate + interval) { const worker = runtime.getTaskWorker(task.name); if (worker) { try { await worker.execute(runtime, {}, task); // Update the task's last update time await runtime.updateTask(task.id, { metadata: { ...task.metadata, updatedAt: now, }, }); } catch (error) { logger.error(`Error executing task ${task.name}: ${error}`); } } } } } Tasks Awaiting User Input‚Äã Tasks tagged with AWAITING_CHOICE are presented to users and wait for their input. These tasks use: The choice provider to display available options to usersThe CHOOSE_OPTION action to process user selections Common Task Patterns‚Äã Deferred Follow-ups‚Äã Create a task to follow up with a user later: runtime.registerTaskWorker({ name: 'FOLLOW_UP', execute: async (runtime, options, task) =&gt; { const { roomId } = task; const { userId, topic } = task.metadata; await runtime.createMemory( { entityId: runtime.agentId, roomId, content: { text: `Hi &lt;@${userId}&gt;, I'm following up about ${topic}. Do you have any updates?`, }, }, 'messages' ); await runtime.deleteTask(task.id); }, }); // Create a follow-up task for 2 days later await runtime.createTask({ name: 'FOLLOW_UP', description: 'Follow up with user about project status', roomId: message.roomId, tags: ['follow-up', 'one-time'], metadata: { userId: message.entityId, topic: 'the project timeline', scheduledFor: Date.now() + 2 * 86400000, // 2 days }, }); Multi-step Workflows‚Äã Implement complex workflows that span multiple interactions: // First step: Gather requirements runtime.registerTaskWorker({ name: 'GATHER_REQUIREMENTS', execute: async (runtime, options, task) =&gt; { // Ask user for requirements and create a new task for the next step await runtime.createTask({ name: 'CONFIRM_REQUIREMENTS', description: 'Confirm gathered requirements', roomId: task.roomId, tags: ['workflow', 'AWAITING_CHOICE'], metadata: { previousStep: 'GATHER_REQUIREMENTS', requirements: options.requirements, options: [ { name: 'confirm', description: 'Confirm requirements are correct' }, { name: 'revise', description: 'Need to revise requirements' }, ], }, }); await runtime.deleteTask(task.id); }, }); // Second step: Confirm requirements runtime.registerTaskWorker({ name: 'CONFIRM_REQUIREMENTS', execute: async (runtime, options, task) =&gt; { if (options.option === 'confirm') { // Move to the next step await runtime.createTask({ name: 'GENERATE_SOLUTION', description: 'Generate solution based on requirements', roomId: task.roomId, tags: ['workflow'], metadata: { previousStep: 'CONFIRM_REQUIREMENTS', requirements: task.metadata.requirements, }, }); } else { // Go back to requirements gathering await runtime.createTask({ name: 'GATHER_REQUIREMENTS', description: 'Revise requirements', roomId: task.roomId, tags: ['workflow'], metadata: { previousStep: 'CONFIRM_REQUIREMENTS', previousRequirements: task.metadata.requirements, }, }); } await runtime.deleteTask(task.id); }, }); Scheduled Reports‚Äã Create tasks that generate and post reports on a schedule: runtime.registerTaskWorker({ name: 'GENERATE_WEEKLY_REPORT', execute: async (runtime, options, task) =&gt; { const { roomId } = task; // Generate report content const reportData = await generateWeeklyReport(runtime); // Post the report await runtime.createMemory( { entityId: runtime.agentId, roomId, content: { text: `# Weekly Report\\n\\n${reportData}`, }, }, 'messages' ); // The task stays active for next week (updateInterval handles timing) }, }); // Create a weekly report task await runtime.createTask({ name: 'GENERATE_WEEKLY_REPORT', description: 'Generate and post weekly activity report', roomId: reportChannelId, worldId: serverWorldId, tags: ['report', 'repeat', 'weekly'], metadata: { updateInterval: 7 * 86400000, // 7 days updatedAt: Date.now(), format: 'markdown', }, }); Task Events and Monitoring‚Äã ElizaOS doesn't currently provide built-in events for task lifecycle, so implement your own monitoring if needed: // Custom monitoring for task execution async function executeTaskWithMonitoring(runtime, taskWorker, task) { try { // Create a start log await runtime.log({ body: { taskId: task.id, action: 'start' }, entityId: runtime.agentId, roomId: task.roomId, type: 'TASK_EXECUTION', }); // Execute the task await taskWorker.execute(runtime, {}, task); // Create a completion log await runtime.log({ body: { taskId: task.id, action: 'complete', success: true }, entityId: runtime.agentId, roomId: task.roomId, type: 'TASK_EXECUTION', }); } catch (error) { // Create an error log await runtime.log({ body: { taskId: task.id, action: 'error', error: error.message }, entityId: runtime.agentId, roomId: task.roomId, type: 'TASK_EXECUTION', }); } } Best Practices‚Äã Use descriptive names and descriptions: Make tasks easily identifiable with clear names and descriptions Clean up completed tasks: Delete one-time tasks after execution to prevent database bloat Add error handling: Implement robust error handling in task workers to prevent failures from breaking workflows Use appropriate tags: Tag tasks effectively for easy retrieval and categorization Validate carefully: Use the validate function to ensure tasks only execute in appropriate contexts Keep tasks atomic: Design tasks to perform specific, well-defined operations rather than complex actions Provide clear choices: When creating choice tasks, make option names and descriptions clear and unambiguous Manage task lifecycles: Have a clear strategy for when tasks are created, updated, and deleted Set reasonable intervals: For recurring tasks, choose appropriate update intervals that balance timeliness and resource usage Handle concurrent execution: Ensure task execution is idempotent to handle potential concurrent executions","keywords":"tasks scheduling automation workers recurring tasks task management","version":"1.0.0-beta"},{"title":"Worlds","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/docs/core/worlds","content":"Worlds Worlds in ElizaOS are collections of entities (users, agents) and rooms (conversations, channels) that form a cohesive environment for interactions. Think of a world as a virtual space, like a Discord server, Slack workspace, or 3D MMO environment, where entities can communicate across multiple channels or areas. Within each world you can have rooms, which are akin to individual threads or channels in a server. World Structure‚Äã A world in ElizaOS has the following properties: type World = { id: UUID; name?: string; agentId: UUID; serverId: string; metadata?: { ownership?: { ownerId: string; }; roles?: { [entityId: UUID]: Role; }; [key: string]: unknown; }; }; Property\tDescriptionid\tUnique identifier for the world name\tOptional display name agentId\tID of the agent managing this world serverId\tExternal system identifier (e.g., Discord server ID) metadata\tAdditional world configuration data The metadata can store custom information, including ownership details and role assignments for entities within the world. World Creation and Management‚Äã Creating a World‚Äã You can create a new world using the AgentRuntime: const worldId = await runtime.createWorld({ name: 'My Project Space', agentId: runtime.agentId, serverId: 'external-system-id', metadata: { ownership: { ownerId: ownerEntityId, }, }, }); For many integrations, worlds are automatically created during connection setup with external platforms like Discord or Slack. Ensuring a World Exists‚Äã If you're not sure if a world exists, you can use ensureWorldExists(): await runtime.ensureWorldExists({ id: worldId, name: 'My Project Space', agentId: runtime.agentId, serverId: 'external-system-id', }); Retrieving World Information‚Äã // Get a specific world const world = await runtime.getWorld(worldId); // Get all worlds const allWorlds = await runtime.getAllWorlds(); Updating World Properties‚Äã await runtime.updateWorld({ id: worldId, name: 'Updated Name', metadata: { ...world.metadata, customProperty: 'value', }, }); World Roles System‚Äã Worlds support a role-based permission system with the following roles: Role\tDescriptionOWNER\tFull control over the world, can assign any roles ADMIN\tAdministrative capabilities, can manage most settings NONE\tStandard participant with no special permissions Managing Roles‚Äã Roles are stored in the world's metadata and can be updated: // Get existing world const world = await runtime.getWorld(worldId); // Ensure roles object exists if (!world.metadata) world.metadata = {}; if (!world.metadata.roles) world.metadata.roles = {}; // Assign a role to an entity world.metadata.roles[entityId] = Role.ADMIN; // Save the world await runtime.updateWorld(world); For programmatic role management, you can use role-related utilities: import { canModifyRole, findWorldForOwner } from '@elizaos/core'; // Check if user can modify roles if (canModifyRole(userRole, targetRole, newRole)) { // Allow role change } // Find world where user is owner const userWorld = await findWorldForOwner(runtime, entityId); World Settings‚Äã Worlds support configurable settings that can be stored and retrieved: // Get settings for a world const worldSettings = await getWorldSettings(runtime, serverId); // Update world settings worldSettings.MY_SETTING = { name: 'My Setting', description: 'Description for users', value: 'setting-value', required: false, }; // Save settings await updateWorldSettings(runtime, serverId, worldSettings); World Events‚Äã ElizaOS emits events related to world activities: Event\tDescriptionWORLD_JOINED\tEmitted when an agent joins a world WORLD_CONNECTED\tEmitted when a world is successfully connected WORLD_LEFT\tEmitted when an agent leaves a world Handling World Events‚Äã // Register event handlers in your plugin const myPlugin: Plugin = { name: 'my-world-plugin', description: 'Handles world events', events: { [EventTypes.WORLD_JOINED]: [ async (payload: WorldPayload) =&gt; { const { world, runtime } = payload; console.log(`Joined world: ${world.name}`); }, ], [EventTypes.WORLD_LEFT]: [ async (payload: WorldPayload) =&gt; { const { world, runtime } = payload; console.log(`Left world: ${world.name}`); }, ], }, }; Relationship with Rooms‚Äã A world contains multiple rooms that entities can interact in. Each room points back to its parent world via the worldId property. // Get all rooms in a world const worldRooms = await runtime.getRooms(worldId); See the Rooms documentation for more details on managing rooms within worlds. Best Practices‚Äã Always check permissions: Before performing administrative actions, verify the user has appropriate rolesHandle world metadata carefully: The metadata object can contain critical configuration, so modify it with careWorld-room syncing: When syncing with external platforms, keep world and room structures in alignmentEvent-driven architecture: Use events to respond to world changes rather than polling for updatesDefault settings: Provide sensible defaults for world settings to make configuration easier","keywords":"worlds environments spaces rooms entities roles permissions events","version":"1.0.0-beta"},{"title":"Frequently Asked Questions","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/docs/faq","content":"Frequently Asked Questions What is Eliza?‚Äã Eliza is an extensible open-source framework for building autonomous AI agents that can engage in natural conversations, learn from interactions, and maintain consistent personalities across platforms like Twitter, Discord, and Telegram.

Analyzing Aave (AAVE) token data. Aave is a decentralized lending and borrowing protocol operating on multiple blockchains, including Ethereum, Polygon, Avalanche, and others. The AAVE token is primarily used for governance, allowing holders to vote on protocol upgrades and changes. It also serves as a safety mechanism, where staked AAVE can be used to cover shortfalls in the protocol. Aave is categorized under 'Decentralized Finance (DeFi)', 'Lending/Borrowing Protocols', and multiple ecosystem integrations, indicating its broad utility and adoption across various blockchain environments. The token is deployed on 12 different platforms, showcasing its cross-chain capabilities. Would you like a deeper analysis of its technical features, market trends, or specific use cases?

Set up your environment variables‚Äã  In the root of the repositorty, copy .env.example to .envFill in the following parameters: SOLANA_PRIVATE_KEYSOLANA_PUBLIC_KEYSOLANA_RPC_URLOPENAI_API_KEY  2. RPC requirements‚Äã  Most often, free-tier RPC URLs are not sufficient for this plugin.  Eliza needs to fetch all your token-accounts in order to find the position NFTs that represent Orca positions. Such calls are done through the getProgramAccounts method of the RPC client, which can be expensive.To ensure transaction landing, the plugin makes use of a client-side retry logic (read more here), which also puts a heavier load on the RPC.The amount of positions you own and the update interval you set can also contribute to RPC limits.  3. Update the agent‚Äã  In agent/src/index.ts, search for the function createAgent, and add solana_plugin_v2 to the AgentRuntime like so:  export async function createAgent( character: Character, db: IDatabaseAdapter, cache: ICacheManager, token: string ): Promise&lt;AgentRuntime&gt; { // Rest of the code ... return new AgentRuntime({ // Other parameters plugins: [ // Other plutins getSecret(character, &quot;SOLANA_PUBLIC_KEY&quot;) || (getSecret(character, &quot;WALLET_PUBLIC_KEY&quot;) &amp;&amp; !getSecret(character, &quot;WALLET_PUBLIC_KEY&quot;)?.startsWith(&quot;0x&quot;)) ? solanaPluginV2 : null, // Rest of the code   4. Use LP Manager character‚Äã  Copy packages/plugin-solana-v2/src/character/orca/lpmanager.character.json to characters/lpmanager.character.json.  5. Install and build the repo‚Äã  Follow the general installation and build steps from the README in the root of the repo  5. Run the agent‚Äã  Start the the agent with the following command:  bun start --characters=&quot;characters/lpmanager.character.json&quot;   Visit https://localhost:3000 to interact with your agent through a web interface.  6. Start prompting‚Äã  Ask the agent what it can do for you. Provide the appropriate parameters and let the agent reposition your positions automatically.  7. Other configurations‚Äã  In packages/plugin-solana-v2/src/utils/sendTransaction.ts, you can set the priority fees. They are by default set to use the dynamic fees, but you can adjust this as you like.

The private key is securely stored in the TEE's encrypted memory. The agent's relevant information, along with the public key and attestation, is recorded in a local database. A new key pair is generated each time the agent is updated or restarted to ensure key security. Log Recording: For each log entry, basic information is recorded, including agentId, roomId, userId, type, content, and timestamp. This information is concatenated and signed using the agent's corresponding private key to ensure verifiability. The verification process follows this trust chain: Verify the attestation.Trust the public key contained in the attestation.Use the public key to verify the signature.Trust the complete log record. Data Storage: All log data must be stored in the TEE's encrypted file system in production environments. Storing data in plaintext is prohibited to prevent tampering. Log Extraction for Verification: Third parties can extract TEE logs for verification purposes. Two types of information can be extracted: Agent Information: This includes the agent's metadata, public key, and attestation, which can be used to verify the agent's public key.Log Information: Required logs can be extracted, with the agent's attestation and public key used to verify the signature, ensuring that each record remains untampered. Integrity Protection: When users extract TEE logs via the REST API, the results are hashed, and an attestation is generated. After extraction, users can verify the attestation by comparing the hash value contained within it to the extracted results, thereby ensuring the integrity of the data.
